Quotes attributable to Chair, Expert Advisory Board, Andrew Penn  The Cyber Security Strategy 2020 built a solid foundation, but as the rate of digital adoption has accelerated so has the threat of malicious cyber activity. We therefore need to increase our defences even further as we aspire to become a world leading digital and cyber secure nation.  Industry clearly has to do better in protecting customer data and implementing cyber security bestpractice and Government must lead by example and demonstrate its own commitment to hardening government systems and defending against cyber threats.  The new Cyber Security Strategy needs to address how everyone can do their part to make Australia more cyber resilient.  Quotes attributable to Expert Lead, Expert Advisory Board, Rachael Falk  The development of a new Cyber Security Strategy for Australia is a unique opportunity. Now more than ever before, this is a time to be ambitious and innovative. Australia should be at the cuttingedge of education and research.  Cyber attacks on government and on industry are only getting worse. The recent large-scale incidents have demonstrated to the community the very real risks online, are not going away and the real-world impacts they can have.   Quotes attributable to Expert Lead, Expert Advisory Board, Mel Hupfeld  The scope, scale, and sophistication of cyber threats is evolving  Australian systems and networks are being targeted by nation-states and cyber criminals.   Cyber resilience requires a coordinated approach by governments, individuals, and businesses of all sizes.   When looking to 2030, Australia must consider our sovereign capabilities in cyber security and how these can be leveraged to ensure the safety and security of our citizens.   Our people are the foundation of cyber security capability  education, skills, talent attraction and continuing professional development will be key to Australias cyber resilience."
