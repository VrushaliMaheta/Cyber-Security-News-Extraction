The Cybersecurity Best Practices for Smart Cities guide has been released in collaboration with our international cyber security partners. Smart cities can create safer, more efficient, more resilient communities through technological innovation and data-driven decision making. However, this opportunity also introduces potential vulnerabilities that are an attractive target for criminals and cyber threat actors. Communities and organisations implementing smart city technologies should account for these potential vulnerabilities as part of their overall risk management approach. This guide provides three recommendations for communities and organisations looking to implement smart city technologies: secure planning and design, proactive supply chain risk management, and operational resilience. Several specific strategies for secure planning and design are provided, to include enforcing multi-factor authentication, implementing zero trust architecture, protecting internet-facing services, and patching systems and applications in a timely manner. Proactive supply chain risk management recommendations include setting clear requirements for software, hardware, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) supply chains, and carefully reviewing agreements with third-party vendors, such as managed service providers and cloud service providers. In the event of a compromise, operational resilience strategies, such as workforce training and incident response and recovery plans, can prepare organisations to isolate affected systems and operate infrastructure with as little disruption as possible.

The proposed reforms will implement an enhanced critical infrastructure security regulatory regime for the aviation and maritime transport sectors. The proposed amendments to the ATSA and MTOFSA are captured in the Transport Security Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill 2022 (TSACI Bill). The TSACI Bill seeks to transition the regulatory framework for the aviation and maritime transport sectors from a focus on unlawful interference (terrorism) to encompass an enhanced all hazards regulatory framework. The enhanced all hazards regulatory framework will encompass any threat that could impact on the confidentiality, integrity, availability, or reliability of an industry participants operations. This forms part of the Australian Governments critical infrastructure reforms and will support a general uplift in security and resilience across the Australian economy. The Department released an Exposure Draft TSACI Bill (989KB PDF), and accompanying Guide to the Bill (625KB PDF), on Wednesday 15 December 2021 for public consultation. Public submissions on the Exposure Draft TSACI Bill were accepted by the Department until Tuesday 1 February 2022.

Data has never been more valuable. It is an increasingly important driver of growth in our modern economy. Whether it is data about individuals, businesses or government, data underpins how we communicate, conduct business, and receive services. At the same time it can be stolen, manipulated or used as a weapon by foreign adversaries and criminals. Australia is harnessing opportunities created by digital technologies and growing the digital economy. It is essential that appropriate data controls and accountability mechanisms are in place to enable a prosperous and secure Australia. This includes the need for a consistent whole-of-economy approach to data security. The Australian Government has delivered strong actions in recent years to meet this evolving digital ecosystem. We acknowledge the valuable feedback that state and territory government agencies and industry have provided throughout these processes. Data definition Data is any information in a form capable of being communicated, analysed or processed (whether by an individual or by computer or other automated means). Data can include personal information, which is information about an individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable  such as their basic contact details, records generated through their interaction with services or the internet, or information about their biometrics (physical or behavioural characteristics). Data can also include population-level data, such as demographics. Data can include information that can be used to describe location (such as geospatial reference details) or the environment (such as biodiversity or the weather). It can also refer to the information captured or generated by the networks of sensors that make up the Internet of Things. Data about systems can include administrative records about businesses and public services. National Data Security Action Plan The development of Australias first National Data Security Action Plan (Action Plan) was announced by the Prime Minister, the Hon Scott Morrison, on 6 May 2021 as part of the Digital Economy Strategy. The Action Plan will define a consistent set of national, whole-of-economy expectations for data security. The Action Plan, as a driver of digital security, is a critical trust and protection measure in the Australian Data Strategy (the Strategy). Released on 14 December 2021, the Strategy sets out a long-term vision to create a national ecosystem of data that is accessible, reliable and relevant. The Strategy has three main tenets  maximising the value of data, trust and protection, and enabling data use. The Strategy is an important step in unlocking the value of data across the economy. To support the Strategy, the Action Plan will take a phased approach to strengthen and coordinate data security policy settings across the Australian Government, state and territory governments and the broader economy. Discussion paper  a call for views On 6 April 2022 the Department of Home Affairs released a discussion paper for consultation on the development of the National Data Security Action Plan. The discussion paper detailed the nature of the evolving threat environment, laid out existing and developing mechanisms to strengthen resilience, and tested proposed options to address identified gaps. The discussion paper sought to: explore with industry, and state and territory governments, on how the government and business can position itself to meet data security expectations, now and into the future consider how data security responsibilities are best assigned to keep Australians data safe open discussion on how Government, businesses and individuals can share responsibility for data security in the future to get the best outcome for everyone. See the National Data Security Action Plan discussion paper (972KB PDF). Consultation and Submissions From 6 April to 24 June 2022, the Department undertook consultation and sought submissions on the Action Plan. During this consultation period, the Department held town halls, targeted roundtables and bilateral meetings, engaging with key stakeholders from industry, international partners and state and territory governments. The Department received 81 submissions in response to the Action Plan discussion paper.

Students participated in a range of challenges that developed their skills in programming, analysis, digital forensics, web application security, cryptography and robotics. The week-long program challenged students through various scenarios, such as identifying cyber intrusions on a computer system and constructing Arduino electrical circuits. The scenarios are designed to engage and immerse students in the world of cyber security. ASD aims to ignite a passion in students for cyber security and STEM-related fields, encouraging them to pursue further studies in these areas. Over the week-long program, students were given a taste of the many different types of careers they could have in cyber security and at ASD. Students were mentored throughout the program by experienced and highly specialised ASD employees. They had the opportunity to learn about modern encryption techniques, how to monitor network traffic, how to conduct forensic examinations of hard drives, and much more. The program also focuses on developing core STEM skills like critical thinking, creativity, collaboration and problem solving. ASD has a range of career opportunities in roles such as cyber security analysts, offensive cyber operators, information security technologists, data scientists and software engineers. ASD seeks diverse and clever people with a rare mix of specialist skills, adaptability and imagination.

These were developed to help small businesses secure their cloud environments and better protect themselves from the most common cyber security incidents. The ACSC worked with Microsoft to develop these guides. By working alongside organisations, both public and private, we are making Australia a hard target for cybercriminals said Abigail Bradshaw, Head of the Australian Cyber Security Centre. We recognise owners and operators of small businesses may not have the resources or time to understand online complexities or establish complicated responses to potential risks. Guides such as these can assist businesses in understanding cyber risk and how to work with a managed service provider, or internal technical employees to ensure a robust cyber posture. Over 76,000 cybercrime reports were submitted to the ACSC in the 2021-22 financial year. On average that equates to one in Australia every 7 minutes.  As technology advances, so should our cyber security. A cybercrime can be devastating and can cause significant financial loss for a small business. On average, cyber incidents cost small businesses over $39,000. These guides are designed to help businesses secure their systems and data said Alexi Boyd CEO Council of Small Business Organisations Australia. The Small Business Cloud Security Guides are just some of the resources available at cyber.gov.au, which help individuals and businesses improve their cyber security. The ACSC Partnership Program enables the sharing of insights and collaborative opportunities to lift the cyber resilience across all sectors of the Australian economy. We encourage all Australians to join our Partnership Program and receive timely information, such as these guides, to help them keep their systems and networks secure, said Abigail Bradshaw. Australian businesses can sign up to become an ACSC Partner. The ACSC is here to help all Australians impacted by cyber incidents.

Conclusion and next steps ANNEX A: ASD Services for Commonwealth entities The Commonwealth Cyber Security Posture in 2022 (the report) informs Parliament on the implementation of cyber security measures across the Commonwealth government, for the period January 2021 to June 2022. As of June 2022, the Commonwealth comprised 97 non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs), 71 corporate Commonwealth entities (CCEs) and 17 Commonwealth companies (CCs). Executive summary The Commonwealth Cyber Security Posture in 2022 (the report) informs Parliament on the implementation of cyber security measures across the Commonwealth government, for the period January 2021 to June 2022. As of June 2022, the Commonwealth comprised 97 non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCCEs), 71 corporate Commonwealth entities (CCEs) and 17 Commonwealth companies (CCs). Throughout this report, the term entities refers to all NCCEs, CCEs and CCs combined. For the purposes of this report, an entitys cyber security posture comprises the following four dimensions: Cyber security hardening: the entitys implementation of cyber security mitigations, primarily the Essential Eight mitigation strategies, to reduce the likelihood of an information communications technology (ICT) system being compromised. Incident preparedness and response: the entitys readiness to respond to cyber security incidents. Leadership and planning: the entitys leadership engagement with cyber security to support a strong cyber security culture. Cyber defence services: the entitys engagement with cyber defence services that detect and stop malicious cyber activity before it can impact a network. The data included in this report is primarily derived from the ASD Cyber Security Survey for Commonwealth Entities. The Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) surveys entities annually regarding their cyber security practices. The survey addresses entities implementation of the Essential Eight Maturity Model; leadership and culture; incident management; and engagement with ASD services. NCCEs are required to respond to the survey under Policy 5: Reporting on Security of the Protective Security Policy Framework (PSPF); all other entities are encouraged to respond. This year, 92% of entities participated in the survey. This data was supplemented by information collected by ASD in the performance of its duties. At various points in this report, reference is also made to relevant findings from the Protective Security Policy Framework Assessment Report 202021 (hereafter referred to as the PSPF Assessment Report), published by the Attorney-Generals Department (AGD). Each financial year, NCCEs must report on their security posture to AGD, with particular reference to implementation of government policies under the PSPF. The PSPF Assessment Report is an aggregated assessment of these findings. That report provides assurance to government and the Australian public that entities are implementing security measures that proportionately address their unique security risk environments. The findings presented here indicate that the cyber security posture across the Commonwealth is well-established in some areas but requires improvement in others. Specifically: Essential Eight maturity levels improved, but remain low, across the Commonwealth. The proportion of entities that have reached Overall Maturity Level 2 through implementation of Essential Eight controls alone increased from 4% in 2021 to 11% this year. The proportion of entities that self-assessed as having reached Maturity Level 2 when compensating controls are taken into account increased from 14% in 2021 to 19% this year. Most entities had prepared for a cyber security incident and were ready to respond as needed. However, the number of entities that had exercised their Incident Response Plan every two years, and the number of entities reporting incidents to the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), was relatively low. 79% of entities had an Incident Response Plan; however only 49% of entities exercised their Incident Response Plan at least every two years. 80% of entities reported at least 80% of cyber security incidents to their senior management. 47% of entities reported 20% or fewer cyber security incidents to the ACSC. In 202122, entities reported 255 cyber security incidents to the ACSC, accounting for 23% of all cyber security incidents reported. There was a general improvement in cyber security leadership and planning across the Commonwealth. However, improvements could be made regarding entities delivery of cyber security training to their workforces. 72% of entities had a cyber security strategy, up from 61% in 2021. 68% of entities provided cyber security training for their workforce at least annually. 34% of entities provided privileged user training at least annually. Engagement with ASDs cyber defence services is low to moderate. 2% of entities have joined the Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) platform. 26% of entities were using the Australian Protective Domain Name System (AUPDNS). 38% of entities were protected by the Domain Takedown Service. Against this backdrop, the ACSC will help entities improve their cyber security posture. The ACSC will seek to: increase the number of entities engaging with the Cyber Maturity Measurement Program (CMMP) and ACSC Cyber Security Uplift Services for Government (ACSUSG) support entities to establish and exercise an Incident Response Plan investigate why some entities report a low percentage of incidents to the ACSC, and identify remediation measures encourage improved rates of annual cyber security workforce training across the Commonwealth increase the number of entities utilising CTIS, AUPDNS and the Domain Takedown Service. 1. Introduction Improving the cyber security of Australias public, private and civil sectors is a priority of the Australian Government. As Australians increasingly rely on the internet and internet-connected devices, the scale of cyber risk continues to grow. Throughout the past year, Australia was the target of malicious cyber actors who, through persistent cyber operations, put Australias security, stability and prosperity at risk. The Australian Government plays an important role in monitoring, shaping and enabling cyber security across the economy. In particular: ASD  through the ACSC  provides cyber security advice and assistance to Australian governments at the federal, state, territory and local levels, business and critical infrastructure, as well as communities and individuals. The Department of Home Affairs (Home Affairs) leads Australias national cyber security policy and strategy, driving cyber security policy improvements across government and industry. AGD manages the PSPF, which sets out government protective security policy and supports entities to effectively implement that policy. The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) drives digital transformation across government by providing strategic and policy leadership, and investment advice and oversight. Within this context, entities  that is, the Australian Governments own departments and agencies  are responsible for maintaining the cyber security of their data and networks. Specifically, each entity is responsible for the security of its own ICT systems pursuant to the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). Under the PSPF, an entitys accountable authority must approve an appropriate security plan to manage security risks. This report provides an assessment of the cyber security posture of entities as at 30 June 2022, covering progress made by entities from 1 January 2021. It is the third report prepared in response to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit's Report 467: Cybersecurity Compliance published in October 2017, which recommended that ASD and AGD report to Parliament annually on the cyber security posture of the Commonwealth. The annual reports are intended to support increased transparency in cyber security reporting. 1.1 Key findings of this report The data included in this report is primarily derived from the annual ASD Cyber Security Survey for Commonwealth Entities. NCCEs are required to respond to the survey under Policy 5: Reporting on Security; all other entities are encouraged to respond. This year, 92% of entities participated in the survey. This data was supplemented by information collected by ASD in the performance of its duties. At various points in this report, reference is also made to relevant findings from the PSPF Assessment Report, published by AGD. Each financial year, NCCEs must report on their security posture to AGD, with particular reference to the implementation of government policies under the PSPF. The PSPF Assessment Report is an aggregated assessment of these findings. That report provides assurance to government and the Australian public that entities are implementing security measures that proportionately address their unique security risk environments. Insight into the cyber security posture of individual entities may increase their risk of being targeted by adversaries. As such, this report does not identify entities by name. Instead, all data has been anonymised. Only aggregated results are provided. For the purposes of this report, an entitys cyber security posture comprises four dimensions: Cyber security hardening: the implementation of cyber security mitigations  primarily the Essential Eight mitigation strategies  to reduce the likelihood of an entitys ICT systems being compromised. Incident preparedness and response: the entitys readiness to respond to cyber security incidents. Leadership and planning: the entitys leadership engagement with cyber security, to support a strong cyber security culture. ASD cyber defence services: the entitys engagement with cyber defence services that serve to detect and stop malicious cyber activity before it can impact a network. The findings presented here indicate that the cyber security posture across the Commonwealth is well-established in some areas, but requiring improvement in others. Specifically: Essential Eight maturity levels remained low, though improving, across the Commonwealth. Most entities had prepared for a cyber security incident and were ready to respond as needed. However, the number of entities that had exercised their Incident Response Plan every two years, and the number of entities reporting incidents to the ACSC, was relatively low. There was a general improvement in cyber security leadership and planning across the Commonwealth; most entities had a cyber security strategy. However, improvements could be made with regard to entities delivery of cyber security training to their workforces. Engagement with ASDs cyber defence services is low to moderate. The remainder of this report provides more detail on these findings and outlines next steps for improvement. Section 2 outlines findings relating to the Commonwealths implementation of technical controls to defend entities ICT environments against cyber security threats. Section 3 outlines findings relating to entities planning and preparedness to respond to adverse cyber security incidents. Section 4 outlines findings regarding the leadership and planning that underpins entities cyber security culture. Section 5 outlines findings regarding entities adoption of cyber defence services provided by ASD. Finally, Section 6 summarises the key findings and offers next steps in the improvement of the Commonwealth cyber security posture. 2. Cyber security hardening The implementation of cyber security controls helps entities defend their ICT environments against a range of threats, thereby avoiding costly remediation, downtime and lost productivity, and loss of public confidence. In relation to network hardening, the cyber security posture of entities was assessed using two data sets: Responses to the ASD Cyber Security Survey for Commonwealth Entities, where entities report whether they have implemented controls recommended by the Essential Eight Maturity Model. Based on those responses, ASD calculates the entities maturity level. Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs (CHIPs) results. CHIPs is an open-source intelligence capability that uses objective and data-driven approaches to detect external indicators of network vulnerability. 2.1 Essential Eight Maturity Model The ACSCs Essential Eight Maturity Model outlines a set of mitigation strategies to help organisations reduce their likelihood of experiencing a cyber security incident, and the impact of the incident if they do. In 2020, ASD conducted a review of the Essential Eight to ensure that it remained contemporary and contestable. This review was based on the Essential Eight assessments carried out across the Commonwealth, engagement with government entities to understand their experiences implementing the Essential Eight, and awareness of the constantly evolving cyber threat environment. In July 2021, the updated Essential Eight Maturity Model was published on cyber.gov.au. 2.1.1 Implementation of the Essential Eight Maturity Model The Essential Eight Maturity Model comprises four maturity levels (Maturity Levels 0 to 3). The higher levels of maturity protect entities against moderate-to-high degrees of sophistication in adversary tradecraft and targeting. As of July 2022, it is a core requirement of the PSPF that entities implement the Essential Eight strategies to at least Maturity Level 2. A networks Overall Maturity Level is equal to its least mature strategy. The Essential Eight Maturity Model comprises the following eight strategies: Application control: ensures only corporately approved software applications can be executed on a computer, protecting against the execution of malicious applications. Patch applications: applying vendor patches or other vendor mitigations prevents known vulnerabilities in applications from being exploited. Configure Microsoft Office macro settings: limits macro programs embedded in Microsoft Office files from executing, thereby preventing potential malicious activity. User application hardening: limits the use of potentially exploitable user application functionality to only what is required, and removes particularly vulnerable software altogether. Restrict administrative privileges: limits the unnecessary provision of administrative privileges, reducing the potential for these to be exploited by adversaries to gain full access to computers and data. Patch operating systems: applying vendor patches or other vendor mitigations prevents known vulnerabilities in operating systems from being exploited. Multi-factor authentication: requires users to present multiple authentication credentials to log in, rather than just using a passphrase, thereby preventing adversaries logging in as a user if they know the users passphrase. Regular backups: making a copy of data, software and configuration settings, storing it securely and periodically testing the ability to restore it, enables data and computers to be restored after an incident such as ransomware or computer hardware failure. The Essential Eight Maturity Model recommends that organisations implement the Essential Eight using a risk-based approach. Where strategies cannot be implemented, these exceptions should be minimised and compensating controls used to manage the resulting risk. If the gap is effectively mitigated, the entity may self-assess that they have achieved maturity against that strategy. 2.1.2 Level of Essential Eight implementation by entities The vast majority of entities have not implemented all the Essential Eight mitigation strategies to Maturity Level 2. Specifically: Only 11% of entities had reached Overall Maturity Level 2, relying on the implementation of Essential Eight controls alone; an increase from 4% in 2021. 19% of entities self-assessed that they had reached Maturity Level 2 when compensating controls to mitigate gaps in the Essential Eight implementation were taken into account; an increase from 14% in 2021. Between 2021 and 2022, the greatest improvements to the number of entities implementing an Essential Eight strategy to Maturity Level 2 were observed in Patch applications (26% improvement) and Patch operating systems (24% improvement) (Figure 1). Regular backups, Application control and Patch operating systems were implemented to Maturity Level 2 by the highest proportion of entities, following the application of compensating controls (Figure 2). User application hardening and Restrict administrative privileges were implemented to Maturity Level 2 by the lowest proportion of entities, following the application of compensating controls (Figure 2). 2.1.3 Protective Security Policy Framework Report 202021 The PSPF Assessment Report includes reporting against Policy 10: Safeguarding data from cyber threats. In 202021, this policy mandated the implementation of four of ASDs Essential Eight mitigation strategies: Application control, Patch applications, Restrict administrative privileges, and Patch operating systems. The PSPF Assessment Report found that 28% of entities had implemented these strategies to a Managing or Embedded[1] level. From July 2022, the PSPF requires entities to implement Maturity Level 2 for each of the Essential Eight strategies.

Over the reporting period, the proportion of domains protected by key security measures increased, while the number of domains hosting dormant websites decreased. Specifically, between February 2021 and May 2022: use of recommended email security[2] rose from 8.0% to 61.3% use of recommended email encryption[3] rose from 17.9% to 41.6% use of recommended web server encryption[4] rose from 15.2% to 28.6% the existence of dormant websites (which might be used to host or launch malicious activity) decreased from 15.0% to 8.8%. These results are further described in Figure 3 to Figure 6. CHIPs reporting indicates that entities are improving their overall implementation of the security protocols above. However, the proportion of Commonwealth domains in which these cyber hygiene measures have not been effectively implemented remains high. Case Study 1: Support to the 2021 Census In August 2021, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ran the eighteenth Census of Population and Housing (Census) in Australia. From planning through to delivery, ASD provided ABS with cyber security advice, assistance and technical uplift to help ensure the cyber security of the Census and its data. Prior to the Census, ASD provided ABS with cyber security advice for its procurement process, a cyber security maturity assessment across ABS networks, a review of the platform hosting the Census, and threat intelligence briefings. ASD employed its cyber defence service capabilities to assess and preempt malicious cyber activity against the Census. Throughout the Census, ASD was in constant communication with ABS and conducted passive monitoring of the ABS systems and incident response support to help detect and respond to threats. On Census night, ASD provided on-site operational support to bolster any critical incident response. ASD found no indication of malicious activity through its assessments, and critical cyber security recommendations were resolved by ABS prior to the Census. The 2021 Census was completed successfully without cyber security incident.

Incident preparedness and response A cyber security event occurs when a system, service or network flags a possible breach of security policy, failure of safeguards or a previously unknown situation that may be relevant to security. A cyber security incident is an unwanted or unexpected cyber security event, or a series of such events, that have a significant probability of compromising business operations. Cyber security incidents may result in the denial of access to, the theft of, or the destruction of systems and data. If not effectively managed, a cyber security incident may undermine public confidence in an organisation, and the incidents remediation may consume significant resources. While it is important to defend against cyber security incidents, it is impossible to avoid them entirely. Entities should plan for, and prepare to respond to, cyber security incidents. This includes identifying the data and systems essential to their business, accounting for cyber security incidents in business continuity planning, and developing and exercising an incident response plan. Reporting cyber security incidents is also essential to ensure that they are dealt with appropriately and that any impact is considered fully. According to Policy 5: Reporting on security, entities are required to report significant or reportable cyber security incidents to the ACSC. Entities are a common target for malicious cyber activity. In 202122, entities reported 255 cyber security incidents to the ACSC, accounting for 23% of all cyber security incidents reported. 3.1 Levels of incident preparedness and reporting In relation to incident preparedness and response, the cyber security posture of entities is assessed using responses from the ASD Cyber Security Survey for Commonwealth Entities. Specifically, entities respond to a series of questions designed to assess their level of preparedness to respond to a cyber security incident, and their incident reporting behaviour. Findings indicate that the majority of entities had planned for a cyber security incident, and were ready to respond, if needed. However, a much smaller proportion of entities had exercised their Incident Response plan. Specifically, as shown in Figure 7: 94% of entities had identified the systems and data most essential to their business; an increase from 90% in 2021. 79% of entities had an Incident Response Plan; an increase from 73% in 2021. 49% of entities exercised their Incident Response Plan at least every two years; an increase from 44% in 2021. Notably, there was little change in these results between 2021 and 2022. Figure 7: Indicators of entities' incident preparedness and response Figure 7 FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 % entities had identified the systems and data most essential to their business  90% 94% % entities had an Incident Response Plan 73% 79% % entities exercised their Incident Response Plan at least every two years 44% 49% % entities that report at least 80% of incidents to their senior executive 77% 80% % entities that report at least 50% of incidents to ACSC 53% 51% While most entities report a high rate of cyber security incidents to their senior management, this is not the case with regard to reporting incidents to the ACSC. Rather, a large cohort of entities report all cyber security incidents to the ACSC, while a distinct cohort report relatively few cyber security incidents to the ACSC. As shown in Figure 7: 80% of entities reported at least 80% of the incidents observed on their network to their senior management; an increase from 77% in 2021. 51% of entities reported at least 50% of incidents observed on their network to the ACSC, a minor decrease from 53% in 2021: 41% reported 100% of incidents observed on their network to the ACSC, increasing from 39% of entities in 2021. 47% reported 20% or fewer incidents observed on their network to the ACSC, increasing from 45% in 2021. 12% reported between 30% and 90% of incidents observed on their network to the ACSC, down from 16% in 2021. Under Policy 5: Reporting on security, entities are required to report significant or reportable cyber security incidents to the ACSC. The low rate of incident reporting may have a variety of causes. Specifically: A proportion of entities may be experiencing a high number of low-impact incidents that do not meet the reporting threshold. A proportion of entities may be experiencing reportable incidents, but do not recognise them as reportable. Case Study 2: Log4j vulnerability response The Log4j vulnerabilities were the most prevalent critical vulnerabilities in the 202122 financial year. On 10 December 2021, ASD issued a public alert, and commenced awareness and response initiatives to mitigate the potential compromise. Due to its widespread use in popular software and hardware platforms, over 100,000 products may contain Log4j. Between December 2021 and January 2022, ASD provided technical support to impacted organisations, releasing 2 Alerts and 2 Advisories flagging the active exploitation. ASD also provided technical advice and guidance for mitigation and detection, hosted 7 information sharing events through the ACSC Partnership Program, and amplified advice on social media, which had a potential reach of over 1 million people. On 22 December 2021, ASD also released a joint public technical advisory on mitigations for Log4j-related vulnerabilities with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand. ASD is aware of malicious actors conducting a large number of reconnaissance scans for Log4j vulnerabilities. Some Australian networks were compromised through Log4j vulnerabilities, and ASD responded to over 50 cyber security incidents. ASD has identified Log4j exploits being used months after the initial disclosure. Log4j is likely to be a means of access for malicious actors for years to come. Case Study 3: AquaEx AquaEx, the national cyber security exercise series coordinated by ASD in partnership with Australian critical infrastructure owners and operators, was held in August 2021. The exercise brought together Australias urban water and wastewater sector and government agencies, with the aim of strengthening industry and government coordinated response to cyber incidents affecting the sector. The exercise was an opportunity for participants to reflect on existing communication and cooperation arrangements to respond to a cyber incident affecting industry, and how these arrangements can be improved. It enabled industry and government to clarify their roles and responsibilities, including reporting responsibilities for organisations affected by a cyber incident. AquaEx involved over 14 months of planning, 50 one-on-one planning conferences, 16 exercise management workshops, 4 information sessions, and the development of a Cyber Incident Response Plan template to assist organisations in developing and updating their cyber incident response plans in preparation for the exercise. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19 lockdowns, the exercise had a record number of participants. In total, more than 750 participants, from 48 organisations (including four entities), took part in the activity, strengthening relationships and enhancing cyber awareness. 4. Leadership and planning Strong leadership is essential in setting and maintaining a strong cyber security culture, and ensuring cyber security remains part of an organisations planning and everyday business. In particular, the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) plays a key role in setting the strategy and direction of an entitys cyber security program. CISOs are typically responsible for providing strategic guidance to their entitys cyber security program and ensuring compliance with cyber security policy, standards, regulations and legislation. The broader workforce also plays a key part in maintaining cyber security, and entities should provide ongoing cyber security awareness training to all personnel to help them to understand their security responsibilities. 4.1 Levels of leadership and planning In relation to leadership and planning, the cyber security posture of entities was assessed through a series of questions designed to provide indications of their entitys cyber security leadership, planning and overall culture. Responses showed improvement on most indicators of leadership and planning (Figure 8). Specifically, as of June 2022: 72% of entities had a cyber security strategy, up from 61% in 2021. 82% of entities addressed cyber security incidents in business continuity planning, up from 75% in 2021. 68% of entities provided cyber security training for their workforce at least annually, increasing from 63% in 2021. 75% of entities participated in the ACSC Partnership Program, increasing from 66% in 2021. Ideally, all entities should engage in these activities. However, the increasingly high uptake across entities signals a general improvement in posture. A notable exception is cyber security training. Responses indicate that 68% of entities provide cyber security training to their workforce at least annually, while 34% of entities provided privileged user training (PUT) to ICT users with elevated privileges at least annually. Figure 8: Indicators of entities' leadership and planning Figure 8 FY 2020-21 FY 2021-22 % entities that have a cyber security strategy 61% 72% % entities that address disruptions due to cyber security incidents in business continuity planning 75% 82% % entities that provide PUT at least annually 35% 34% % entities that provide cyber security training at least annually 63% 68% % entities that participate in the ACSC Partnership Program 66% 75% Case Study 4: Ransomware - Exercise Blue Dawn Ransomware is one of the most disruptive threats to Australian organisations. In April 2022, ASD coordinated Exercise Blue Dawn, a simulated ransomware cyber security incident, for its Network Partners within the ACSC Partnership Program. The exercise supported participants from a range of sectors to clearly identify their strengths and weaknesses, and improved their holistic organisational responses to ransomware. The 62 participating entities stated that they learned from each others expertise and experiences with ransomware, incident response and planning. Conducting cyber security exercises such as this are an integral part of cyber security preparedness, where relevant personnel or organisations come together in a simulated environment to discuss, review and develop response plans, policies, and capabilities. As a result of the exercise, participants indicated that they would review and further develop their organisations incident response and preparedness plans. In addition, 98% agreed that Blue Dawn enhanced their ability to perform their roles under similar circumstances and that their participation was appropriate and beneficial to their roles. The ACSC continues to develop close collaboration opportunities for ACSC Network Partners to build cyber resilience and maturity for all Australian organisations. Case Study 5: Australian Protective Domain Name System (AUPDNS) AUPDNS enhances the security of government networks by blocking connections to malicious websites that may contain ransomware, malware and other cyber threats. ASD and its industry partner make this service available to all federal, state and territory governments. AUPDNS has proven to be invaluable for threat detection and intelligence gathering, as well as for disrupting or deterring cyberattacks at the reconnaissance phase. Since the AUPDNS pilot began in March 2020, ASD has analysed abnormal Domain Name Service (DNS) traffic flows to detect possible malicious activity and, through this, either mitigate or reduce the harm of an intrusion for entity customers. AUPDNS has become the largest contributor of indicators of compromise to ASDs CTIS platform, providing over 80% of CTIS inputs. During the reporting period, AUPDNS processed more than 30 billion queries and blocked more than 20 million connections to known malicious domains. By the end of the 202122 financial year, 49 entities were using the service. As more entities connect to AUPDNS, ASD achieves greater cyber threat visibility and defence. 5. Cyber defence services The cyber defence services offered to entities by ASD are designed to detect and stop malicious cyber activity before it can impact organisations or the community. Cyber defence services are intended to tackle the high-volume attacks that affect many targets, from government entities to individual internet users, rather than highly sophisticated and targeted attacks. As such, these services are generally scalable and designed to block malicious cyber activity while in train. It is recommended that all entities take advantage of cyber defence services, either by accessing those provided by ASD or engaging a commercial service. 5.1 ASD services available to entities ASD provides cyber defence services to entities to mitigate low-sophistication attacks before they impact the network, including: Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) In November 2021, ASD began operating the new CTIS platform. CTIS allows participating entities to share observable indicators of compromise (IOCs) at machine speed. Participating organisations can then use these IOCs to identify activity on their own networks. The CTIS platform also allows participating organisations to bi-directionally share IOCs observed on their own networks with other CTIS partners. Since its launch, 28,000 IOCs have been shared on CTIS. Australian Protective Domain Name System (AUPDNS) The AUPDNS uses threat intelligence to build a block list of known and assessed malicious web domains. These domains are often used to distribute malware, as part of malicious command-and-control channels, or as part of a data-exfiltration channel. AUPDNS prevents devices on subscribed networks from accessing the malicious domains on the block list, thereby interrupting potential malicious activity. Between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2022, more than 20 million malicious domain requests were blocked by AUPDNS. Domain Takedown Service The Domain Takedown Service prevents malicious resources from being hosted on unsuspecting entities web domains. The service detects potentially malicious activity that is using subscribed entities web domains, verifies that this activity is malicious, and issues a takedown notification request to the Domain Host (i.e. the internet service that manages that domain). The majority of takedown notifications are automatically initiated within one minute of identification. Within the reporting period, 70,000 domain takedown notifications were sent to entities. 5.2 Uptake of ASDs cyber defence services The uptake of ASDs cyber defence services was assessed using information collected by ASD as part of their normal operations. According to ASD records, as of 30 June 2022: 2% of entities had joined the CTIS platform 26% of entities were using AUPDNS 38% of entities were protected by the Domain Takedown Service. 6. Conclusion and next steps Cyber security must be a priority for all entities. The findings presented in this report indicate that the cyber security posture across the Commonwealth is well-established in some areas, but requiring improvement in others. In particular: Most entities do not meet the minimum requirements for cyber security, as described in the Essential Eight Maturity Model. This conclusion is supported by the PSPF Assessment Report. Most entities had prepared for a cyber security incident, and were ready to respond as needed. However, the number of entities that had exercised their Incident Response Plan every two years, and the number of entities reporting incidents to the ACSC, was relatively low. There was a general improvement in cyber security leadership and planning across the Commonwealth. However, further improvements could be made with regard to entities delivery of cyber security training to their workforces. Engagement with ASDs cyber defence services is low to moderate across the Commonwealth. 6.1 Next steps Against this backdrop, entities should work to: prioritise, and appropriately resource, improvements to their cyber security posture in line with the Essential Eight establish and exercise an effective cyber security Incident Response Plan review their cyber security incident reporting practices provide annual cyber security training and privileged user training across their workforce seek to engage with ASDs cyber defence services. The ACSC will help entities to improve their cyber security posture. The ACSC will: increase the number of entities engaging with the Cyber Maturity Measurement Program (CMMP) and ACSC Cyber Security Uplift Services for Government (ACSUSG) support entities to establish and exercise an Incident Response Plan investigate why some entities report a low percentage of incidents to the ACSC, and identify remediation measures encourage improved rates of annual cyber security workforce training across the Commonwealth increase the number of entities utilising CTIS, AUPDNS and the Domain Takedown Service. 6.2 Final comments The importance of effective cyber security will continue to grow as the Commonwealth government increasingly relies on the internet and internet-connected devices. Entities continue to improve their cyber security posture. However, considerable improvement is still required to meet the rapidly evolving cyber threat environment. 6.3 Report to Parliament 2023 The Commonwealth Cyber Security Posture in 2023 Report to Parliament will be delivered in November 2023. This report will focus on the 202223 financial year. ANNEX A: ASD Services for Commonwealth entities Cyber security hardening From 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022 1 major update to the Essential Eight Maturity Model was published in July 2021 678 ISM updates were published 11 entities engaged in CMMP 22 entities engaged in ACSUSG 212 IRAP-accredited assessors providing IRAP services Quarterly CHIPs scans were performed across government networks 62 HOT CHIPs scans were performed across government networks Technical publications ASD publishes the Information Security Manual (ISM), the Essential Eight Maturity Model, and the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, all of which outline the technical strategies and controls designed to defend against cyber threats. ASD also publishes additional guidance on topics of particular relevance, such as cloud and gateway services. Cyber Maturity Measurement Program (CMMP) ASDs CMMP works with entities to assess their networks implementation of the Essential Eight mitigation strategies and their broader cyber security posture. Entities are provided with a snapshot of their networks cyber security posture and tailored advice and recommendations to improve. ACSC Cyber Security Uplift Services for Government (ACSUSG) ASDs ACSUSG service provides entities with skilled ICT professionals to implement security controls and provide further recommendations aligned with the ACSCs findings and advice provided through complementary offerings. Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) Through the IRAP, ASD endorses suitably qualified professionals to provide cyber security services to support broader industry and Australian Government. IRAP assessors can provide security assessments of ICT systems, cloud services and gateways. Active Vulnerability Assessments (AVA) AVA is ASDs red team capability, designed to assess the network and system security of Australias most critical, nationally significant and sophisticated infrastructure. Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs (CHIPs) CHIPs uses open source techniques to measure the cyber posture and hygiene of government internet-facing systems and assets. It uses objective and data-driven approaches to detect external indicators that a network may be vulnerable to exploitation. CHIPs provides quarterly reports to Commonwealth, state, territory and local government entities, detailing vulnerability posture and findings for each entity. High-Priority Operational Tasking Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs (HOT CHIPs) ASDs HOT CHIPs scans identify network and system vulnerabilities relating to high-priority threats. These scans build ACSC visibility of the government attack surface, and help network owners to build cyber hygiene quickly by providing timely and actionable threat intelligence. Host Based Sensor Program (HBS) ASDs HBS program provides visibility of the cyber security posture of Australian Government ICT systems by collecting telemetry data from government devices. This enables ASD to help entities identify weaknesses and detect intrusions on their ICT infrastructure, and mitigate the consequences of compromise. Incident preparedness and response From 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022 67 calls, on average, were received by the Cyber Security Hotline each day 55 entities engaged in a National Exercise Program exercise 3 Hunt activities were conducted for entities 30 exercises were run by the National Exercise Program 20 workshops were run by the National Exercise Program 3548 downloads of the Cyber Incident Response Plan were undertaken Alerts and Advisories ASD publishes alerts and advisories to cyber.gov.au to inform Australians on cyber security threats. Individuals may subscribe to the ACSC Alert Service to have such alerts forwarded to them automatically. Cyber Security Hotline The Australian Cyber Security Hotline 1300 CYBER1 (1300 292 371) provides advice and assistance to Australian individuals and organisations impacted by cyber security incidents. The Hotline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Incident Response ASD provides incident response services to all entities that have been compromised by malicious cyber actors. ASD prioritises deployment of specialised digital forensics and incident response services in response to incidents causing significant impact to Australia and/or incidents involving high harm actors. Hunt ASD proactively conducts cyber threat hunt operations on important Australian networks to detect intrusions by sophisticated cyber actors. This service is offered to entities, including in support of events of national significance. In such cases, ASD is invited by the entity to conduct a hunt, and works in partnership with the entity for the duration of the hunt activity. National Exercise Program (NEP) The National Exercise Program (NEP) runs scalable and agile exercises to help participants validate and improve their cyber security arrangements. The NEP also runs cyber security training workshops for industry and government. ASD periodically runs large-scale exercises, such as AquaEx, described in Case Study 3. Cyber Incident Response Plan and Readiness Checklist In January 2022, the ACSC published a Cyber Incident Response Plan Template and Cyber Incident Response Readiness Checklist. These documents are designed to help entities develop a cyber incident response plan to support an effective incident response. Leadership and planning From 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022 140 entities were invited to each CIO/CISO forum 110 entities were invited to each ITSA forum 39 ACSC newsletters were published to the Partnership Portal 119 entities were members of the ACSC Partnership Program 28% of entities enrolled participants in PUT Chief Information Officer (CIO)/CISO, Information Technology Security Advisor (ITSA) forums and newsletter ASD runs a number of forums annually for Commonwealth government CIOs and CISOs, as well as additional forums for ITSAs. A newsletter is also published for participants. The forums and newsletters bring together senior cyber security practitioners to discuss strategic cyber security matters, as well as technical topics and tools. During the reporting period, ASD provided updates on the Hardening Government IT Initiative (HGIT), the Critical Infrastructure and Systems of National Significance (CISoNS) reforms, Essential Eight Maturity Model updates, and ASD incident response activities. Lessons learned from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and the 2021 Census were also provided by participating entities. Partnership Program The ACSC Partnership Program enables a wide range of organisations to engage with the ACSC. Through the Partnership Program, ACSC provides technical advisories, sector-based threat intelligence, news and advice to enhance situational awareness, collaboration opportunities, and resilience-building activities. Privileged User Training (PUT) ASD provides in-person and online Privileged User Training (PUT) for ICT users who hold system privileges beyond that of a normal user. Privileged users are technical staff with duties and system access that enable them to adjust and maintain the configurations of ICT systems. The course provides an overview of best-practice cyber security, including mitigating cyber security incidents in privileged users day-to-day work. ASDs PUT is intended for entities that dont have the capacity or requirement to run in-house training for their privileged users. Entities may provide their own alternative. Cyber defence services From 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022 28,000 IOCs were shared via the CTIS platform. 20 million malicious domain requests were blocked by AUPDNS 70,000 domain takedown notifications were sent to entities Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) In November 2021, ASD began operating the new CTIS platform. CTIS allows participating entities to share observable indicators of compromise (IOCs) at machine speed. Participating organisations can then use these IOCs to identify activity on their own networks. The CTIS platform also allows participating organisations to bi-directionally share IOCs observed on their own networks with other CTIS partners. Australian Protective Domain Name System (AUPDNS) The AUPDNS uses threat intelligence to build a block list of known and assessed malicious web domains. These domains are often used to distribute malware, as part of malicious command-and-control channels, or as part of a data-exfiltration channel. AUPDNS prevents devices on subscribed networks from accessing the malicious domains on the block list, thereby interrupting potential malicious activity, see Case Study 5. Domain Takedown Service The Domain Takedown Service prevents malicious resources from being hosted on unsuspecting entities web domains. The service detects potentially malicious activity that is using subscribed entities web domains, verifies that this activity is malicious, and issues a takedown notification request to the Domain Host (i.e. the internet service that manages that domain). The majority of takedown notifications are automatically initiated within one minute of identification.

The Report provides an overview of key cyber threats impacting Australia, how the ACSC is responding to the threat environment, and crucial advice for Australian individuals and organisations to protect themselves online. Foreword I am pleased to present the third Annual Cyber Threat Report by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), a key part of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). Throughout its 75 year history, ASD has defended Australia from global threats and advanced our national interests. It remains at the frontline of defending our nation and keeping Australia safe and secure. We are currently witnessing deteriorating strategic circumstances in our region and globally, including a military build-up unseen since World War II, and expanding cyber and grey zone capabilities are of particular concern. In this environment, the work performed by ASD and its ACSC is more important than ever. This expanded Annual Cyber Threat Report 202122 is the product of insights from across the Commonwealth, with the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Defence Intelligence Organisation and the Department of Home Affairs also contributing to help all Australians better understand the cyber threat environment and improve their cyber defences. Over the last financial year and reflecting strategic competition globally, we have all witnessed a heightened level of malicious cyber activity. Regrettably, too many Australians have also felt its impacts. The government considers cyber security and reinforcing our online resilience to be a national priority. Increased investment in ASDs cyber and intelligence capabilities under project REDSPICE (Resilience, Effects, Defence, SPace, Intelligence, Cyber, Enablers) positions Australia to lift our defences and recognises the critical role ASD plays in our national security. This report maps how threat actors across the world have continued to find innovative ways to deploy online attacks, with supply chains used to penetrate cyber defences of governments and organisations in many countries, including Australia. The better news is that with increased collaboration across industry, small business, and governmentand with all Australiansour joint cybersecurity future and the digital opportunities before us remain bright. In many ways, this report is the product of all Australians with its foundations and findings formed by reports to the ACSC. Reporting cybercrime is vital for us to build a threat picture that can prevent others from falling victim to the ransomware syndicates and cybercriminals. The best cyber defence is informed by the best intelligence. Together we can reach our ambitious goal to make Australia truly the most secure place to connect online. This report is another important step forward. The Hon Richard Marles, MP Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Executive Summary Over the 202122 financial year, the deterioration of the global threat environment was reflected in cyberspace. This was most prominent in Russias invasion of Ukraine, where destructive malware resulted in significant damage in Ukraine itself, but also caused collateral damage to European networks and increased the risk to networks worldwide. In Australia, we also saw an increase in the number and sophistication of cyber threats, making crimes like extortion, espionage, and fraud easier to replicate at a greater scale. The ACSC received over 76,000 cybercrime reports, an increase of nearly 13 per cent from the previous financial year. This equates to one report every 7 minutes, compared to every 8 minutes last financial year. The ACSC identified the following key cyber security trends in the 202122 financial year: Cyberspace has become a battleground. Cyber is increasingly the domain of warfare, as seen in Russias use of malware designed to destroy data and prevent computers from booting in Ukraine. But Russia was not alone in its use of cyber operations to pursue strategic interests. In July 2021, the Australian Government publicly attributed exploitation of Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities to Chinas Ministry of State Security. And a joint Five-Eyes Advisory in November 2021 confirmed exploitation of these vulnerabilities by an Iranian state actor. Regional dynamics in the Indo-Pacific are increasing the risk of crisis and cyber operations are likely to be used by states to challenge the sovereignty of others. Australias prosperity is attractive to cybercriminals. According to a 2021 Credit Suisse report, Australia has the highest median wealth per adult in the world. In 202122, cybercrimes directed at individuals, such as online banking and shopping compromise, remained among the most common, while Business Email Compromise (BEC) trended towards targeting high value transactions like property settlements. Ransomware remains the most destructive cybercrime. Ransomware groups have further evolved their business model, seeking to maximise their impact by targeting the reputation of Australian organisations. In 202122, ransomware groups stole and released the personal information of hundreds of thousands of Australians as part of their extortion tactics. The cost of ransomware extends beyond the ransom demands, and may include system reconstruction, lost productivity, and lost customers. Worldwide, critical infrastructure networks are increasingly targeted. Both state actors and cybercriminals view critical infrastructure as an attractive target. The continued targeting of Australias critical infrastructure is of concern as successful attacks could put access to essential services at risk. Potential disruptions to Australian essential services in 202122 were averted by effective cyber defences, including network segregation and effective, collaborative incident response. The rapid exploitation of critical public vulnerabilities became the norm. Australian organisations, and even individuals, were indiscriminately targeted by malicious cyber actors. Malicious actors persistently scanned for any network with unpatched systems, sometimes seeking to use these as entry points for higher value targets. The majority of significant incidents ACSC responded to in 202122 were due to inadequate patching. In the face of rising threats to the digital-dependent Australian economy, cyber defence must be a priority for all Australians. The most effective means of defending against cyber threats continues to be the implementation of the Essential Eight cyber security strategies. To support this, the ACSC launched several new initiatives in 202122 to improve Australias cyber resilience, such as a Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing (CTIS) platform which automates sharing of indicators of compromise. The Australian Governments ten year investment in ASD, known as REDSPICE, will further harden Australias cyber defences in 202223 and beyond. What the ACSC saw: An increase in financial losses due to BEC to over $98 million an average loss of $64,000 per report. A rise in the average cost per cybercrime report to over $39,000 for small business, $88,000 for medium business, and over $62,000 for large business an average increase of 14 per cent. A 25 per cent increase in the number of publicly reported software vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures  CVEs) worldwide. Over 76,000 cybercrime reports an increase of 13 per cent from the previous financial year. A cybercrime report every 7 minutes on average compared to every 8 minutes last financial year. Over 25,000 calls to the Cyber Security Hotline an average of 69 per day and an increase of 15 per cent from the previous financial year. 150,000 to 200,000 Small Office/Home Office routers in Australian homes and small businesses vulnerable to compromise including by state actors. Fraud, online shopping and online banking were the top reported cybercrime types, accounting for 54 per cent of all reports. What the ACSC did: Responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents. Blocked over 24 million malicious domain requests through the Australian Protective Domain Name System. Took down over 29,000 brute force attacks against Australian servers through the Domain Takedown Service. Took down over 15,000 domains hosting malicious software targeting Australias COVID-19 vaccine rollout. Shared over 28,000 indicators of compromise with ACSC Partners through the Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing platform. Collaborated with partners on 5 successful operations against criminal online marketplaces and foreign scam networks. Responded to 135 ransomware incidents an increase of over 75 per cent compared to 201920. Notified 148 entities of ransomware activity on their networks. Conducted 49 high priority operational tasks in response to identified and potential significant cyber threats including scanning for vulnerable Australian devices.

Report all cybercrime and cyber security incidents to the ACSC via ReportCyber. Cybercrime and cyber security incident statistics Cyber security incidents responded to by the ACSC are growing in severity. Cybercrime has a significant impact on organisations of all sizes; in 202122 the average loss per report across businesses increased 14 per cent compared to 202021. Cybercrime and cyber security incidents remain underreported and the ACSC urges Australian organisations and individuals to report all cybercrimes and cyber security incidents. A cybercrime is an offence committed through or against information and communications technology (ICT). Cybercrimes are either cyber enabled (using ICT to facilitate offences such as fraud or sexual exploitation) or cyber dependent (crimes which can only be committed via ICT, such as the use of ransomware or other malware). A cyber security incident is an event, or series of events, that has a significant probability of compromising an organisations operations. Not all cybercrimes lead to cyber security incidents, and the following statistics are from 2 distinct datasets: cybercrimes reported to ReportCyber, and cyber security incidents to which the ACSC responded. The cost of cybercrime As the volume of cybercrime increases, cybercriminal methodology evolves, and digital transactions blur national borders, it is becoming increasingly difficult to accurately estimate the total cost of cybercrime. Cybercrime can cause financial and reputational damage, disrupt business and essential services, and result in permanent damage to an organisation. Self-reported financial loss data as submitted to ReportCyber only captures a small portion of the total financial impact of cybercrime. It does not capture the cost to the customers of victims, nor the capital and recurring costs of cyber security incident remediation. Frequency of cybercrime reports During the 202122 financial year, over 76,000 cybercrime reports were made via ReportCyber, an increase of nearly 13 per cent from the previous financial year. One cybercrime report is made approximately every 7 minutes, compared to one report every 8 minutes in 202021.  Figure 1: Cybercrime reports by month for 202122 financial year compared with 202021 financial year Cybercrime reports by state and territory Australias more populous states continue to report more cybercrime. Queensland and Victoria report disproportionately higher rates of cybercrime relative to their populations. However, the highest average reported losses were by victims in the Northern Territory (over $40,000 per cybercrime report where a financial loss occurred) and Western Australia (over $29,000). Note: Assigned jurisdiction is the state or territory law enforcement agency assigned to each ReportCyber report. This may differ from the physical location of the victim. Cybercrime by type The most frequently reported cybercrimes were all cyber enabled crimes: online fraud: approximately 27 per cent online shopping: approximately 14 per cent online banking: approximately 13 per cent. Cyber dependent crimes, such as ransomware, were a very small percentage of total cybercrime reports. Nevertheless, the ACSC assesses that ransomware remains the most destructive cybercrime threat. This is because ransomware has a dual impact on victim organisationstheir business is disrupted by the encryption of data, but they also face reputational damage if stolen data is released or sold on. The public are also impacted by disruptions and data breaches resulting from ransomware.  Figure 3: Cybercrime reports by type for financial year 202122 Cybercrime loss by organisation size Medium-sized businesses (defined by Australian Bureau of Statistics as between 20 and 199 employees) had the highest average loss per cybercrime report where a financial loss occurred. This may be because they were less likely than large organisations to apply cyber security mitigations as outlined in the ACSCs Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents. These strategies decrease the likelihood and impact of cyber incidents. In addition, medium-sized organisations may be more likely to report cybercrime to ReportCyber, as they are less likely than larger organisations to have sufficient in-house or commercial incident response capabilities. The ACSC urges organisations to report all cybercrime, irrespective of the financial loss incurred, as it helps to better understand and defend against the threat.   Figure 4: Cybercrime reports and average reported loss by organisation size for financial year 202122 Note: The 2021 Annual Cyber Threat Report averaged financial loss across all cybercrime reports. This years Report averages only those cybercrime reports where financial loss occurred. The ACSC assesses that excluding reports where no financial loss occurred provides more accurate and actionable data for businesses. Calls to the ACSC The number of calls to 1300 CYBER1 has continued to increase. The ACSC received more than 25,000 calls in the 202122 financial year, an average of 69 calls per day. This is a 15 per cent increase on the 202021 financial year and over a four-fold increase from the 201920 financial year, when the ACSC received 5,300 calls. Cyber security incidents During the 202122 financial year, the ACSC responded to over 1,100 cyber security incidents, an average of 21 cyber security incidents per week. Compared to the 202021 financial year, this is a decrease of 36 per cent. This does not mean that the cyber security threat to Australian organisations has decreased, especially as the number of cybercrime reports has increased. The expansion of Australias commercial incident response sector means incidents which may have previously required an ACSC response may now be being handled by in-house or contracted incident response teams. Cyber security incident severity The ACSC categorises each incident it responds to on a scale of Category 1, the most severe, to Category 6, the least severe. Incidents are categorised on severity of effect, extent of compromise, and significance of the organisation. The number and severity of cyber security incidents in the 202122 financial year is not directly comparable with previous financial years, as the ACSC introduced a new incident categorisation scale in March 2022. This was due to the introduction of mandatory incident reporting for Regulated Critical Infrastructure under amendments to the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (SoCI Act). Changes included simplifying the scale, prioritising incidents related to Critical Infrastructure and Systems of National Significance networks and refining definitions of cyber effects and impacts. The severity of cyber security incidents is increasing. Nearly 15 per cent of incidents in the 202122 financial year were categorised as C3, up from approximately 6 per cent in the previous financial year. This is partly attributable to the category changes, but also to an increase in attacks by cybercriminals on larger organisations and an increased impact on victims. Attacks included the exfiltration of sensitive data and the movement by malicious actors across multiple segments of affected networks.  Figure 6: Cyber security incidents by incident category for financial year 202122 Cyber security incidents by sector Excluding government sectorswhich have some additional reporting obligationsthe health care and social assistance sectors reported the highest number of cyber security incidents during the 202122 financial year. Compared to the 202021 financial year, the retail sector dropped out of the top 10, replaced by the electricity, gas, water and waste service sector. The top 10 reporting sectors accounted for approximately 75 per cent of all incidents for the 202122 financial year. As such, these sectors are a focus for ACSC partnership and outreach activities.  Figure 7: Cyber security incidents to which the ACSC responded in financial year 202122, top 10 industry sectors Note: The reporting frequency of government agencies is in part due to their obligations to report significant cyber security incidents to the ACSC, and may not necessarily reflect a greater susceptibility to cyber security incidents. State actors Russias invasion of Ukraine has increased the cyber threat globally. Malicious state actors continue to seek sensitive information, including by targeting Australian small businesses and individuals. Most compromises identified by the ACSC used relatively simple tradecraft which could have been prevented by enhanced cyber security. Gaining a foothold to steal our secrets In 202122, state actors continued to engage in malicious cyber operations as an efficient method of political and economic espionage. State actors seek sensitive informationincluding personally identifiable information (PII)to support their governments intelligence requirements. However these actors do not just want classified information. They also want to understand who we are, how we connect with each other, and what values we hold. Furthermore, in some cases, they may seek to pre-position in strategic networks to prepare for coercive or disruptive activity against us. Over the past financial year, Australia continued to be the target of persistent cyber espionage by a wide range of state actors due to its regional and global interests, international partnerships and participation in multilateral forums. This cyber espionage is often conducted or directed by foreign intelligence services seeking information from public and private networks across Australia, including political, diplomatic, military, technological and commercial data, as well as personal data from individual Australians. The ACSC collaborated with Australian, state and territory government agencies to ensure events such as the Census and state and federal elections were resilient to malicious cyber activity by state or criminal actors. Case Study: ACSC support to the Census The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) ran the Census in August 2021. ABS systems are an attractive target for malicious actors, including state actors, as they hold personal information about Australians. The ABS was particularly concerned with maintaining the availability of the Census systems, the confidentiality of Australians information, and the integrity and utility of the collected data. The ACSC provided a range of services to the ABS to assess and improve the cyber security of its systems. Prior to the Census, the ACSC provided ABS with threat intelligence briefings. The ACSC also employed its active cyber defence capabilities to assess and pre-empt malicious cyber activity against the Census. The ACSC conducted a review of ABS systems, including a source code review and penetration testing to detect cyber security vulnerabilities, and analysis to detect if there was malicious activity already on the system. Recommendations resulting from the review were provided to the ABS. Throughout the Census, the ACSC monitored ABS systems to help detect and respond to threats. On Census night, the ACSC provided on-site operational support to bolster any critical incident response. The ACSC found no indication of malicious activity through its assessments, and critical cyber security recommendations were resolved by the ABS prior to the Census. The Census was completed without any cyber security incident or disruption to services. While state actors have access to a wide range of sophisticated and bespoke capabilities, the majority of compromises the ACSC observed used relatively simple tools and techniques. These include spear phishing, targeting third-party service providers and exploiting unpatched or misconfigured systems using public vulnerabilities. The exploitation of public vulnerabilities is low cost and scalable, and exploits can be deployed within hours of a patch release or technical write up. Exploiting public vulnerabilities also avoids the need to use zero-day exploitsvulnerabilities that have not been disclosed or patched by the software vendorallowing state actors to preserve these for use against the highest value targets. State actors will likely continue to use simple tools and techniques to target government and business networks for as long as it remains effective, inexpensive and scalable. Cyber operations as a geostrategic tool The Indo-Pacific is at the centre of geostrategic competition, and cyber operations are a valuable tool in this contest. Some countries use cyber operations to gain advantage by stealing other nations security secrets and intellectual property at a greater scale than in the past. They can also use cyberspace to sow disinformation, interfere in economies and shape public sentiment. If necessary, states can launch cyberattacks that sabotage and destabilise their adversaries. Much of this can be done covertly, at relatively low cost and in ways that make it hard for other states to deter or respond. Cyberspace itself has become a battleground. Some countries in our region continue to strain the norms and institutions that govern cyberspace as a global commons. These countries have increasingly cut access to the open internet and used digital tools to repress freedoms. These countries seek to export their approach and impose it on others by undermining international standards and technical protocols. Australia opposes these actions and is committed to a free and open Internet. In April 2022, Australia joined over 60 other nations in launching A Declaration for the Future of the Internet, which describes our position on the potential for digital technologies to uphold the values that promote connectivity, democracy, and the rule of law. Cyberspace is also a joint warfighting domain, with cyber effects increasingly incorporated into military operations. Some countries are acquiring cyber capabilities which can hold-at-risk the networks other countries rely on. To hold-at-risk is to demonstrate the capability to overcome the defences of another country, to undermine confidence in networks and enable state actors to cripple essential services in the event of a conflict. Cyber operations in military conflict Russias invasion of Ukraine has altered the geopolitical balance in ways that could expose organisations to increased malicious cyber activity. Ukrainian government officials have acknowledged they are fighting a dual warone on the ground and one in the digital realm. Cyber operations have been used as a tool of war alongside a major ground offensive, with malicious cyber activity against Ukrainian networks before and during the conflict. Ukraine has experienced an onslaught of sustained disruptive cyber activity, including distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. While the impact of this malicious activity has been mitigated by Ukraines cyber defensive measures, it still has the potential to cripple essential services and have cascading effects. In the first 6 weeks of the invasion, at least 8 variants of destructive malware were identified, including wiper malware designed to erase data and prevent computers from booting. Against this backdrop, the integration of cyber operations into conventional war has drawn non-traditional combatants and civilian entities into the conflict. Criminal syndicates and issue-motivated groups have conducted activities in support of Russian or Ukrainian interests, independent of Russian and Ukrainian government chains of command. Issue-motivated groups have made claims of successful attacks against government and private networks, including exfiltration and posting of data on the darkweb. Such activities facilitate future potential cyberattacks by malicious state and non-state actors. A subset of the malicious cyber activity which occurred in the first 60 days of the war is below. Disruptive activities continue unabated, and escalating geopolitical tensions will likely see the continued use of cyber effects as a means of dissuasion, disruption, degradation or denial. Cyber risks to Australian networks Russias invasion of Ukraine demonstrated the real threat of disruptive and destructive cyber operations, including the potential for third parties to suffer collateral damage. Some Russian cyber operations impacted beyond their primary target sets. For example, a 24 February 2022 attack on a satellite communications company had spillover effects across geographic borders. In addition to causing outages across Ukraine, this attack disabled over 10,000 satellite communications terminals outside Ukraine, including terminals that supported the operation of wind turbines and internet services for private citizens. Previous cyberattacks against Ukraine have also had international consequencessuch as the NotPetya malware in 2017, which affected companies worldwide, including in Australia. Russian cyber actors may conduct malicious activity as a response to military materiel support provided by the US, UK, Australia and other partners, as well as the economic costs imposed on Russia. Australia would be vulnerable in future regional or global conflicts to cyber operations that target the supply chains that Australian systems depend upon. This would be the case even if Australia were not directly involved. There would probably be little warning of such disruption. Australian network owners need to consider how to secure their critical systems and protect their sensitive information; for instance, through improved segmentation between their corporate and operational networks. What the ACSC is doing In the lead-up to the invasion, DDoS attacks targeted Ukraines finance sector and banks. On 20 February 2022, Australia joined the US and UK in publicly attributing these cyberattacks to the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate. On 23 February 2022, the ACSC released an Alert and an Advisory urging Australian organisations to urgently adopt enhanced cyber security postures by prioritising the following actions: patching applications and devices implementing mitigations against phishing and spear phishing attacks ensuring that logging and detection systems are fully updated and functioning reviewing incident response and business continuity plans. In cooperation with our international partners from Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, on 21 April 2022, the ACSC released a joint Advisory specifically on Russian state and cybercriminal threats to critical infrastructure. The Advisory urges critical infrastructure network operators to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by hardening their cyber defences and performing due diligence to identify indicators of compromise. In addition, the ACSC has increased engagement with international partners to share tactics and techniques, and worked closely with industry partners to share knowledge of the threat environment. The ACSC briefed more than 200 business organisations on the risk of collateral damage to Australian networks following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and has also provided multi-classification threat briefings to government and critical infrastructure partners. Beyond the immediate threat presented by Russias invasion of Ukraine, the ACSC works to counter the risk of malicious activity by a wide range of state actors. By the end of the 202122 financial year, the Advisory had: been updated 10 times. received more than 57,000 views, and a potential reach of more than 950,000 users through ACSC's social media platform.

Numerous Russian government and military organisations have the capability to undertake cyber operations against ICT and OT networks, including elements of: The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) The Russian Ministry of Defence What you should do How to protect yourself from state actors Individuals and organisations are not just targeted for their own data holdings; their networks can be weaponised against others. For example, in 202122 personal devices and small office or home office (SOHO) routers were used by foreign intelligence services to conduct espionage and theft of intellectual property. Malicious actors can use these routers to conduct person-in-the-middle compromises or as a vector to target other networks. The ACSC estimates that at least 150,000 to 200,000 devices in Australian homes and small businesses are vulnerable. Small businesses and individuals should prioritise automated updates, which help prevent network compromises by even the most sophisticated actors. The ACSC also provides step-by-step guides to secure your accounts and devices at cyber.gov.au. Larger organisations should continue to implement the Essential Eight cyber security strategies. REDSPICE The global strategic environment is deteriorating. The rapidly advancing technological landscape presents great opportunities but also serious threats. Cyberspace is of increasing importance to warfare and national security. REDSPICE (Resilience, Effects, Defence, SPace, Intelligence, Cyber, Enablers) will be pivotal to addressing future cyber threats. REDSPICE will expand the range and sophistication of ASDs intelligence, offensive and defensive cyber capabilities, and deliver forward-looking capabilities essential to maintaining Australias strategic advantage and capability edge over the coming decade and beyond. It will: help anticipate and prevent a crisis block sophisticated cyberattacks against Australian critical infrastructure provide offensive capabilities that equip government with retaliatory options ensure Australias cyber and intelligence capabilities remain resilient to attack.   3X current offensive cyber capability 2X persistent cyber-hunt activities The REDSPICE investment will help train a new generation of cyber and intelligence experts to protect Australia from cyber adversaries. 1900 new analyst, technologist, corporate, and enabling roles across Australia and the world Analysts: Create our edge, solve the problems other cannot. Technologists: Use emerging and cutting-edge technology and big data to solve complex problems. Corporate & Enabling Services: Enable our purpose. A nationally and internationally distributed workforce will create additional redundancy in ASDs critical capabilities and opportunities for greater partnership with industry, academia and other sectors of the Australian economy. 40 per cent staff located outside Canberra 4X global footprint REDSPICE will provide new intelligence capabilities and build our threat intelligence picture, including through threat intelligence sharing with ACSC partners. Enhanced National Cyber Defence Improves resilience of critical infrastructure against sophisticated cyber attacks Increases the visibility of threats to Australias most critical systems Improves machine-time cyber threat intelligence sharing across government and industry Doubles persistent cyber-hunt activities and nationwide cyber-incident response. REDSPICE provides $5 billion in opportunities for Australian industry, including small and medium Australian enterprises. This will grow the wider Australian cyber security sector. Cybercrime Cybercrime continues to pose a high threat to Australias economic and social prosperity. Cybercriminals are increasingly persistent in targeting all sectors of Australias economy. Compromises trended towards targeting high-value transactions like property settlements. Proliferation of threats Australia is an attractive target for cybercriminals. Our widespread internet connectivity, per capita wealth, and investment structuressuch as moveable superannuation accounts and widespread share ownershipare all powerful incentives for cybercriminals. During the 202122 financial year, fraud, financial and identity theft and BEC continued to be common cyber threats due to their volume and ability to cause severe and long-term harm. Many actors used common techniques such as spear phishing to compromise victims networks. Australias cybercrime environment over 202122 was underpinned by the constant, rapid evolution of cybercriminal techniques used to target Australia for profit. This evolution was not limited to malware but encompassed all aspects of the cybercriminal environment, including target identification and exploitation, service delivery, cash-out methods, and supporting infrastructure. Ultimately, while cybercrime capabilities became more sophisticated, they also became more accessible for less technologically skilled actors. This ongoing evolution enabled cybercriminals to consistently adapt to environmental changes, while remaining resilient to disruption efforts by law enforcement. Cybercrime-as-a-Service The evolution of Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) continued to increase the overall cybercrime threat to Australia. CaaS encompasses an ever-increasing range of purchasable tools, services and information used to facilitate cybercriminal operations. Examples of CaaS include, but are not limited to, the complicit provision of server infrastructure used to host cybercriminal campaigns, the sale of access to compromised victim networks, money laundering services, and the development and obfuscation of malware. The availability of these enabling functions means that individual actors are not required to be an expert in every component of a criminal operation. In effect, cybercriminals are outsourcing elements of their operations, and a growing black market is serving their needs.  Figure 8: Cybercrime-as-a-Service ecosystem The expansion of the CaaS industry has lowered the barrier to entry for actors seeking to conduct cybercrime. For instance, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) provides actors who may not have the technical skill to develop their own ransomware with an opportunity to launch highly profitable attacks. In addition, the CaaS industry allows actors to monetise their expertise in a particular skillset. As a consequence, cybercriminals have become more specialised over 202122, and pose a greater threat to Australians and businesses. During 202122, the ACSC collaborated with partners on 5 successful operations against criminal online marketplaces and foreign scam networks. While offshore cybercrime groups have exploited Australian victims, individual actorsincluding Australian citizensremain a threat. Australian law enforcement agencies have leveraged international partnerships to tackle criminal behaviour across the globe. Case Study: Operation Boone In October 2021, the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court ordered the forfeiture of $1.66 million by a 23-year-old Sydney man. This followed his conviction for selling illegally obtained logins for online services such as Netflix. More than $1.2 million of the proceeds were in cryptocurrency, making for the largest seizure of cryptocurrency in Australian history. This was the culmination of Operation Boone, a five year joint investigation by the AFP and the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Australian man conspired with a US individual to steal the credentials of streaming service customers. The Australian sold the credentials through 4 account-generator websites which had over 150,000 users. The proceeds were money-laundered through a complex system of PayPal accounts and cryptocurrency wallets. Following an extensive investigation, the AFP seized the cryptocurrency and Paypal accounts and charged the Australian with 5 offences. Operation Boone demonstrates how the AFPs cybercrime investigation and asset confiscation capabilities work together. The Australian was sentenced to a 2 year, 2 month intensive corrections order, while the confiscated $1.66 million will be reinvested in the Australian community through initiatives that include local crime prevention and drug treatment programs. For individuals, the case study highlights the importance of not reusing passwords. The theft of streaming service login relied on credential stuffingusing stolen usernames and passwords to access other services via automated logins. If account owners had used secure passphrases or multi-factor authentication (MFA), their accounts would not have been compromised by the offender. Business Email Compromise BEC, where malicious actors compromise organisations via email, continues to be lucrative for cybercriminals. BEC is not limited to scamming businesses out of money or goods. Cybercriminals also use BEC to pretend to be business representatives or to trick employees into revealing confidential business information. BEC is also an entry point for malicious actors to move into higher value targets within networks. The compromise of a single employee email can be a prelude to a major ransomware attack. In 202122, the number of successful BEC reports declined slightly to 1514. However, self-reported losses in 202122 increased significantly to over $98 million. Nationally, the average loss per successful BEC increased to over $64,000. The most BEC reports came from Queensland (389 reports), but average self-reported financial losses were highest in Western Australia, at approximately $112,000 per report. Western Australia had several reports of financial losses over $1 million due to BEC, lifting its overall average. Investigations into BEC suggest property settlements are being targeted. This is likely due to the high value of transactions. Property prices increased further during the coronavirus pandemic and digital settlement methods became more entrenched, making property transactions an attractive target. Despite the best efforts of law enforcement agencies, only a small fraction of BEC financial losses are ever recovered.  Figure 9: Breakdown of successful BEC reports by jurisdiction for financial year 202122 AFP Initiative: Operation Dolos Operation Dolos is an AFP-led, multi-agency taskforce which counters transnational cybercriminals conducting or facilitating BECa cybercrime which commonly crosses borders. Operation Dolos targets and disrupts the BEC crime model, ultimately disrupting transnational organised cybercrime syndicates. To do this, Operation Dolos works with individual Australians and small to medium businesses that have been targeted by BEC, and disrupts the flow of proceeds to and from BEC syndicates. In December 2021, the AFP announced the arrest of 18 money mules by NSW Police, Victoria Police, and Queensland Police. In the 202122 financial year, Operation Dolos was able to recover over $5.97 million in funds stolen by cybercriminals. Case study: Falsified invoices via BEC In July 2021, an Australian financial firm fell victim to BEC, paying over $600,000 on behalf of one of their clients after receiving a falsified invoice. The invoice appeared to be legitimate and from a business that they regularly dealt with, but the bank details had been altered to an account controlled by cybercriminals. The funds were laundered through the purchase of cryptocurrency, gold bullion, cash withdrawals and other purchases. In April 2022, AFP Cyber Command, NSW Police, and Victoria Police conducted a joint activity under Operation Dolos and arrested the member of the syndicate responsible for laundering the proceeds of the crime. Over $140,000 was recovered and returned to the victim. The case study illustrates the importance of verifying requests for large payments and banking changes, even when they appear to come from businesses with an established reputation. Technical controls such as MFA and secure email gateways can also protect organisations from BEC. How to protect yourself from cybercrime Cybercriminals are increasingly persistent in targeting all sectors of Australias economy. Financial losses divert resources from other areas of critical need. The ACSC seeks to counter this targeting through tailored advice to different sectors of Australian society; for instance through the Act Now Stay Secure communication and uplift program. Over the 202122 financial year, the Act Now, Stay Secure advertising campaign: delivered over 57 million online ads to Australians though social media, video and search reached over 6.2 million Australians through broadcast radio advertising was supported by an organic social media campaign with a potential reach of 637,000 people was amplified by 191 stakeholders sharing campaign content to their own channels. Act Now, Stay Secure themes: July 2021 Email Security August 2021 Backups September 2021 Annual Cyber Threat Report October 2021 Updates November 2021 Online Shopping The launch of the Australian Cyber Security Hotline The launch of the online learning resources on cyber.gov.au The launch of the Small Business Cyber Security guide February 2022 Secure Your Portable Devices Cyber Security Instruction Manual: A Kid's Guide  March 2022 Backups ACSC Alert and Advisory April 2022 Ransomware May 2022 Password Managers June 2022 Email Security Ransomware The ACSC assesses that ransomware remains the most destructive cybercrime threat. All sectors of the Australian economy were directly impacted by ransomware in the last financial year. The ACSC provides tailored advice on ransomware mitigation, including for individuals and small business. Ransomware targeting Ransomware is a cyber dependent crime which can impact everyone from consumers through to countries. For example, the Costa Rican Government declared a state of emergency in May 2022 following ransomware attacks on nearly 30 government institutions, including its health, finance, energy and social services departments. While Australia has not experienced an incident of this scale, the potential remains for cybercriminals to cause widespread disruption. Top-tier ransomware groups are continuing to target Australian big game entitiesorganisations that are high profile, high value, or provide critical services. While global trends indicate a decline in big game targeting and a shift towards targeting small and medium sized businesses, that change has yet to be seen in Australia. The business model of ransomware groups continued to evolve. Some ransomware groups now share victim information, increasing the ransomware threat as victims potentially face targeting by more than one group. For example, after announcing its shutdown, the BlackMatter group transferred its victims to ransomware infrastructure owned by another group, known as Lockbit 2.0. And, in October 2021, members of the Conti ransomware group reportedly began selling access to victims networks, enabling follow-on targeting by other actors. Ransomware tactics The combination of data encryption and threats to publicly release sensitive information as a method of pressuring ransomware victims into paying is known as double extortion. Victims who previously would have been able to recover from a ransomware incident by maintaining regular backups may still be vulnerable to reputational damage resulting from double extortion. In 202122, ransomware actors continued to incorporate additional extortion tactics in their operations to more effectively extract payment from victims. This is often referred to as multifaceted extortion. Examples of additional extortion tactics include convincing third-party stakeholders to pressure victims into negotiation, and sustained DDoS attacks against the victims network during ransom negotiations. Ransomware-as-a-Service The ACSC observed the emergence of new and possibly rebranded RaaS operations over 202122. The availability of RaaS offerings affords cybercriminals a choice about the tools they can use. Ransomware syndicates also continued to professionalise by using third parties to negotiate with victims, assist them in receiving their ransom payments, and arbitrating disputes between actors. Pre-crime: Cybercriminals establish themselves online and obtain the necessary skills, experience and/or relationships to be successful.   Preparation: Cybercriminals design and implement their operating model, including establishing technical and financial infrastructure and selecting their target.   Money Movement 1 - Cybercriminal to Service Providers   Actualisation: Cybercriminals commit the crime, including conducting network reconnaissance, exfiltrating data and encrypting files.   Engage and negtiate: Cybercriminals engage with victim/third party to apply pressure and/or negotiate ransom payment.   Money Movement 2 - Victim to Cybercriminal   Exit: Cybercriminals conclude the crime and cease all victim contact. Depending on ransom payment, cybercriminals will leak or decrypt victim data.   Money Movement 3 - Cybercriminal to Criminal Associates   Post-crime: Cybercriminals profit from the activity, including laundering the funds to safely access the proceeds of crime. Cybercriminals pay collaborators and advertise success to enhance reputation.  Figure 10: The ransomware business model Ransomware trends All sectors of the Australian economy were directly impacted by ransomware in 202122. The ACSC received 447 ransomware cybercrime reports via ReportCyber. While this is a 10 per cent decrease compared with the 202021 financial year, reports remain higher than in 201920. It is also likely that ransomware remains significantly underreported, especially by victims who choose to pay a ransom. The education and training sector reported the most ransomware incidents in 202122, rising from the fourth-highest reporting sector in 202021. The threat to the education and training sector is significant as its business model favours open collaborative environments. Remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic also introduced large numbers of personal devices and new software into this sector. The top 5 reporting sectors for ransomware accounted for 47 per cent of all ransomware-related cybercrime reported to ReportCyber during the 202122 financial year. The ACSC responded to 135 cyber security incidents related to ransomware, an increase of over 75 per cent compared to 201920. In addition, the ACSC identified and notified 148 organisations of ransomware activity  Figure 11: Top 5 reporting sectors for ransomware-related cyber security incidents AFPACSCACIC Initiative: Operation Orcus In July 2021, the AFP established Operation Orcus, an AFP-led multi-agency taskforce to coordinate law enforcement efforts against ransomware, particularly targeting ransomware developers and those who use RaaS. The taskforce comprises AFP, ACSC, ACIC, AUSTRAC and state and territory police. Operation Orcus also works with international partners, including Interpol and Europol. During 202122, Operation Orcus analysed hundreds of ransomware incidents and prepared and distributed intelligence reports. Operation Orcus detected indicators of compromise showing Australian organisations being targeted by ransomware, and notified impending victims. These notifications prevented attacks and protected Australian organisations from financial loss. Data breaches Cybercriminals target the PII of employees and customers, seeking to maximise the commercial and reputational impact of a data breach. In the last financial year, human resources organisations such as payroll and recruitment companies have been frequently targeted by ransomware actors, as these types of companies provide services across a wide range of sectors. Compromises of payroll providers in 202122 led to the data of hundreds of thousands of Australian employees being accessed and exposed. Social assistance organisations, which hold sensitive data on vulnerable people, have also been targeted in Australia and internationally. For example, in January 2022, the Swiss-based International Committee of the Red Cross publicly stated a ransomware attack on its servers had compromised the personal data of more than half a million people, including refugees and internally displaced people in conflict zones across the world. Case Study: Australian social assistance organisation In March 2022, an Australian social assistance organisation was targeted by ransomware resulting in the theft of data. The malicious actor gained access to the organisations servers through exploiting an unpatched version of Microsoft Exchange. Within 4 days, the malicious actor moved from initial access to encryption. The organisations Chief Information Security Officer told the ACSC, it spins my head about how quickly they were able to move around the network. The organisation identified that its systems had been encrypted and immediately notified Commonwealth and state agencies. It engaged its existing commercial incident response provider to provide technical support and conduct an investigation. The organisation credits its ability to recover so quickly to maintaining a strong relationship with their incident response provider and moving to cloud-based backups in the months before the incident. Remediation and related network security improvements cost approximately $200,000, which was substantially less than the ransom demanded. Since this incident, the organisation continues to monitor for residual risk, and is hardening its cyber defences more broadly, including enhanced restrictions for applications, and better managed network awareness. During the organisations engagement with the ACSC, it shared indicators of compromise, which the ACSC shared through the CTIS portal. This enabled other organisations to better protect themselves, ultimately strengthening the security of Australian organisations. Cost to victims of ransomware Regardless of the size of the victim, ransomware can be expensive to resolve. The most immediate costs come from the lost productivity due to system downtime, and the time and money needed to rebuild systems following an incident. The legacy of a ransomware incident poses additional challenges, such as tarnishing a victims reputation among its customers. Case Study: Australian healthcare organisation A Sodinokibi (also known as REvil) ransomware group targeted a medium-sized business in the Australian healthcare sector, encrypting critical files and preventing access to business-critical systems. The malicious actor demanded several hundred-thousand dollars in exchange for the decryption keys and an assurance that the stolen data would not be publicly released. Even with the involvement of specialists, ransomware incidents can take months to resolve. In this instance, despite the engagement of a law firm, third-party negotiator and insurance company, and a willingness by the victim to pay the ransom, resolution and restoration of data took approximately 3 months, severely impacting business operations for the victim. Victims of ransomware attacks continued to use third-party negotiators to facilitate payment of ransom demands in 202122. The level of coverage provided under cyber insurance policies is also a contributing factor in how these incidents are handled and resolved by victims, and whether a business decides to pay the ransom. A 2022 study published by the Australian Institute of Criminology found only 19 per cent of ransomware victims sought advice or support from police or the ACSC. However, the study found nearly 60 per cent sought help from at least one formal source outside of their family or friends. The study found 23.2 per cent of small to medium business victims paid the ransom, with many millions of dollars being paid in ransoms and other associated costs. ACSC advice on payment of ransom demands The ACSC advises against paying a ransom. Doing so does not guarantee a victims files will be restored, nor does it prevent the publication or sale of any stolen data. Along with increasing the likelihood of a victim being targeted again, each ransom payment also bolsters the viability of the ransomware market and puts other Australian organisations at greater risk. Irrespective of the decision to pay a ransom, all victims are strongly encouraged to report ransomware-related cybercrime and cyber security incidents to the ACSC. This is essential to develop national visibility of ransomware threats, including emerging trends and ransomware precursors. Even when organisations have sufficient in-house or contracted incident response to address a ransomware incident, sharing technical and contextual information with the ACSC enables the ACSC to implement measures to reduce ransomware targeting and protect other potential victims. Ransomware Action Plan On 13 October 2021, Australias Ransomware Action Plan was released. The plan outlined the proposed capabilities and powers that Australia would use to combat ransomware, and a suite of reforms designed to help the Australian Government better assist victims of ransomware attacks and prosecute ransomware groups. Complementing a range of measures under the 2020 Cyber Security Strategy, the plan seeks to ensure that Australia remains a hard target for cybercrime by launching additional operational activity to target criminals seeking to disrupt, and profit from, Australian business and individuals. What you should do How to protect yourself from ransomware To support Australians in preventing and mitigating ransomware incidents, the ACSC provides technical advice and guidance, including profiles of ransomware actors, via cyber.gov.au. The ACSC also collaborates with domestic and international intelligence and law enforcement partners to disrupt the syndicates causing the greatest harm, and provide operational intelligence regarding cybercriminals targeting Australia. This is a part of a whole-of-government approach to combating ransomware. Organisations can protect themselves from ransomware using the ACSCs tailored guidance below.

Become an ACSC partner and participate in ACSC initiatives and exercises. Critical infrastructure The disruption of critical infrastructure puts access to essential services at risk. Globally, critical infrastructure has been increasingly targeted by malicious actors. Current critical infrastructure threat The cyber threat to Australias critical infrastructure is an enduring concern, because the social or economic well-being of the nation depends on critical infrastructure assets working in cohesion. Critical infrastructure encompasses the physical facilities, communication networks, and information and operational technologies that provide essential services. A sustained disruption in one part of the critical infrastructure ecosystem has knock-on effects elsewhere in the economy, and could ultimately lead to harm or loss of life, as seen internationally as a consequence of ransomware attacks on health services. The potential remains for state actors and cybercriminals to cause similar disruption through targeting of Australian critical infrastructure entities. During 202122, critical infrastructure networks globally were targeted at phenomenal rates. Russias targeting of Ukrainian critical infrastructure was particularly prolific, including the use of destructive malware against high-voltage electrical substations. However, the threat is not limited to Ukraine. Some Russia-aligned cybercrime groupsincluding one that has successfully targeted Australian critical infrastructurehave publicly threatened to conduct operations against Ukraines allies. The risk to Australias critical infrastructure networks is real. In 2021, the corporate network of electricity generator CS Energy was targeted by the Russia-aligned Conti ransomware group, as detailed below. Case Study: CS Energy In 2021, the corporate ICT network of Queensland Government-owned electricity generator CS Energywhich generates 10 per cent of the electricity for the national electricity marketwas targeted by the Conti ransomware group. On 27 November 2021, CS Energy became aware of a ransomware incident affecting its corporate network and immediately severed the external internet connection to its corporate network and initiated business continuity procedures. CS Energy also alerted relevant Australian Government and Queensland Government agencies, and as an established ACSC partner, closely collaborated with ACSC incident response support and external specialists to remedy the incident. As a result of network segregationa recommended mitigation for business continuityCS Energys operational technology systems were physically segregated from the corporate network, ensuring that the incident did not compromise operational technology systems, including electricity generation. Energy supplies were not affected by the incident. This incident highlights the value of network segmentation and the importance of having incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place. By acting decisively, CS Energy, commercial incident response and cyber security specialists, and the ACSC worked together to respond to the incident, demonstrating the maturity of Australias cyber security sector. Not all targeting of critical infrastructure is geostrategic; some is profit-motivated, and some is opportunistic exploitation of widespread vulnerabilities. Even the most trivial exploitation can result in major impact, especially if malicious actors move laterally from internet-facing devices on corporate networks to the operational networks of critical infrastructure providers. Certain critical infrastructure networks face additional challenges, such as the use of legacy operational technology with long life cycles (up to 50 years for some operational hardware), making patching and monitoring of networks more difficult. Critical infrastructure trends During 202122, the ACSC reshaped its definition of critical infrastructure to better align with the definitions of Regulated Critical Infrastructure and Systems of National Significance under the SoCI Act. In the 202021 financial year, the ACSC defined approximately one quarter of cyber security incidents it responded to as affecting critical infrastructure. However, this definition covered a range of infrastructure and services outside the scope of the SoCI Act, and also captured some severe incidents regardless of sector. In the 202122 financial year, using the new definitions, 95 cyber incidents (approximately 8 per cent of all cyber incidents the ACSC responded to) affected critical infrastructure. Since the implementation in April 2022 of amendments to the SoCI Act, the ACSC has notified 5 critical infrastructure entities of cyber incidents and vulnerabilities on their networks. The ACSC urges organisations to report all cyber security incidents, regardless of whether or not their organisation is subject to mandatory reporting under the SoCI Act. Reporting increases the visibility of threats, enables the identification of trends, and supports the prevention and mitigation of future incidents. Ransomware and critical infrastructure Over 202122, there were further examples of ransomware groups targeting critical infrastructure. For instance, the BlackCat ransomware group targeted government and critical infrastructure organisations, as well as the finance and construction sectors globally. The threat to critical infrastructure is not limited to large utilities such as electricity providers. For example, local governments can be an attractive target, as some councils have responsibility for essential services such as water and sewage. Case Study: Local council ransomware incident In April 2022, a NSW council was targeted by a ransomware incident. The initial access occurred at least 2 weeks before the incident, with the malicious actor likely timing the incident to occur over the Easter long weekend. Manual processes were immediately implemented to manage water-quality testing and level monitoring, and temporary servers were established within 24 hours to restore remote monitoring. The incident impacted a wide range of business operations, including council minutes, employee financial data, and systems responsible for monitoring water quality. The incident also had a huge impact on council technology staff, who worked 4080 hours overtime a week during their initial response. The council engaged a commercial incident response provider, and its Managed Service Providers (MSP) deployed additional capabilities. The ACSC provided advice to the council and warned ACSC partners in the water sector to be alert to possible ransomware targeting. The incident demonstrates the interplay between IT, operational technology, and the physical environment. The initial access through a legacy entry point impacted multiple systems, including operational technology systems, which meant that council workers had to manually test water quality and levels following overnight rain. A swift response by the council, its MSP, and the ACSC ensured there was no compromise of water or sewage services. The councils MSP continues to monitor the darkweb for data leaks. The case study demonstrates the importance of decommissioning legacy systems and erecting firewalls between IT and operational technology systems. Advice and support for critical infrastructure organisations A wide range of critical infrastructure providers are subject to mandatory cyber incident reporting requirements, including critical food, transport and higher education assets. The ACSC has a dedicated portal for reporting cyber security incidents that impact critical infrastructure assets, including a list of critical infrastructure sectors and asset classes following amendments to the SoCI Act. In recognition of the additional cyber security obligations critical infrastructure organisations have, the ACSC offers tailored critical infrastructure exercise and uplift programs. These assist ACSC partners to implement risk mitigation strategies. ACSC initiative: AquaEx In August 2021, the ACSC coordinated a national cyber security exercise series in partnership with Australias urban water and wastewater sector and government agencies. The exercise series provided an opportunity for industry and government to exercise arrangements for responding to, and recovering from, a ransomware incident impacting Australias urban water and wastewater sector. Planning for the exercise series included exercise management workshops and cyber security information sessions. These provided opportunities for participants to share approaches to preventing, detecting and responding to ransomware incidents. Executive and senior management were actively engaged in the exercise series, with some organisations conducting their largest ever exercises. Participating executives have indicated that they would like their organisation to be involved in more exercises like AquaEx in the future. It is this level of support and engagement at senior levels that will continue to increase organisational cyber resilience. Opportunities that have been identified as a result of AquaEx include organisations continuing to review and exercise their cyber response plans, expanding their playbooks to include more threat vectors, and solidifying the relationships developed between industry and government. Despite COVID-19 impacts, the exercise reached over 750 participants from across industry and government who were able to work together to strengthen cyber resilience across the nation. ACSC initiative: Critical Infrastructure  Uplift Program In support of Australias critical infrastructure, in 202122 the ACSC piloted the Critical Infrastructure Uplift Program (CI-UP). CI-UP is a voluntary service provided by the ACSC to help protect Australias essential services from cyber threats by raising the cyber security levels of critical infrastructure organisations. Through close collaboration between the ACSC and partners, CI-UP evaluates the cyber security maturity of critical infrastructure and systems of national significance. A combination of Cyber Security Capability and Maturity Model (C2M2) and Essential Eight maturity models are used to deliver prioritised vulnerability and risk management strategies. The pilot concluded in June 2022. The ACSC now provides 2 models for CI-UP service: CI-UP: A modular suite of cyber security maturity activities undertaken through close collaboration with the ACSC to deliver holistic cyber security maturity uplift for CI-UP partners. CI-UP (Self-Assessment): A self-assessment C2M2 evaluation tool enabling ACSC partners to access online resources through the ACSC Partner Portal. Case Study: CI-UP pilot uplift In late 2021, the ACSC undertook multiple pilot uplifts with critical infrastructure organisations at differing cyber security maturity levels. In one pilot, the ACSC partnered with Queensland Airports Limited (QAL) to understand the maturity of its cyber security. This uplift was conducted remotely due to COVID-19 impacts, but was successful nonetheless due to QALs proactive engagement. The active participation gave the CI-UP team a deep understanding of QALs baseline cyber security posture, enabling the provision of targeted advice. Despite the challenges of working during COVID-19 restrictions, the ACSC and QAL teams collaborated to deliver one of QALs most successful cyber outcomes to date. As a result, QAL has a better understanding of its holistic cyber security posture, and a prioritised list of recommended remediation activities to continue hardening its cyber defences. Critical vulnerabilities The ACSC observed an increasing trend of state actors and cybercriminals rapidly exploiting publicly reported critical security vulnerabilities. Rapid and comprehensive patching is vital, along with constant monitoring for indicators of compromise. Vulnerabilities being targeted faster and by more actors During 202122, the number of software vulnerabilities recorded worldwide increased by more than 25 per cent compared to the previous financial year. Over 24,000 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were identified during 202122. Of these, there were numerous critical and high-impact vulnerabilities, with notable examples including vulnerabilities in Microsoft Azure, Log4j products. Within hours of disclosure, the ACSC identified malicious actors conducting scanning and reconnaissance against internet-accessible networks to identify unpatched software. In some instances, cyber actors successfully compromised Australian networks using publicly disclosed critical vulnerabilities. The rapid use of newly released critical vulnerabilities is now standard tradecraft for many malicious actors. Certain software and hardware is used ubiquitously across government, critical infrastructure, small business and by individual users, presenting malicious actors with a plethora of potential victim networks. When a new vulnerability emerges, the ACSCs Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs (CHIPs) frequently identifies numerous Australian devices which are unpatched and vulnerable to exploitation. ACSC Initiative: Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs (CHIPs) CHIPs is an ACSC capability that tracks and monitors the cyber security posture of Australian, state, territory and local government entities internet-facing assets. CHIPs also conduct rapid operational tasking when potential cyber threats emerge, such as newly disclosed vulnerabilities. Through these activities, CHIPs can quickly build visibility of security vulnerabilities across all levels of government and provide vulnerability notifications to system owners. In 202122, 49 high priority operational tasks were undertaken to protect Australian networks, including scans of government entities and Australian-attributed Internet Protocol addresses for potential compromise by critical vulnerabilities. Case Study: Australian energy provider Following the public disclosure of a vulnerability in April 2022, the ACSCs CHIPs program contacted several Australian organisations from across the government, critical infrastructure, transportation and services sectors, notifying them of potentially vulnerable software on their internet-facing servers, and offering assistance. One of the organisations contacted was an Australian energy provider. Immediate actions from the energy provider in response to ACSCs notification confirmed 2 servers had been exploited. Existing network segmentation, specifically a demilitarised zone (DMZ)a network kept separate from the core network to protect information from less trusted networks, such as the internetworked as intended. As a result, energy operations were not disrupted. The provider was quick to remediate by restoring the affected servers from backups and applying relevant patches. Further to the actions of the energy provider, the ACSC conducted a forensics investigation to reconstruct the steps taken by the malicious actors. The investigation found that multiple instances of successful exploitation of the vulnerability occurred in a very short period of time. Evidence suggests that exploitation was conducted by multiple actors, including state-sponsored and criminal entities, much of which was likely automated. Sophisticated actors sought to access user login data, with the likely intent to gain more persistent access once the compromise was remediated. The responsiveness of the energy provider and strong network segmentation were crucial to containing the compromise. Comparative critical vulnerabilities timelines The time between vulnerability disclosure and exploit is closing rapidly; what once took weeks is now taking days or even hours. The following timelines highlight the shortening window for organisations to mitigate threats: Confluence What is Confluence? A web-based database tool for team collaboration, developed by Australian technology company Atlassian. 25 August 2021 Atlassian publicly announced a vulnerability (CVE-202126084) in certain versions of Atlassian Confluence and released software version updates the same day.   31 August 2021 A Proof of Concept for the exploit was published online; first public reports of exploitation occurred the same day.   1 September 2021 A CHIPs scan detected malicious actors scanning for, and attempting to exploit, this vulnerability on Australian networks. The ACSC published an Advisory the same day. Key takeaway Over two-thirds of the cyber security incidents the ACSC responded to relating to this vulnerability occurred in the first 6 days following the Proof of Concept, underscoring how new vulnerabilities are being rapidly exploited by malicious actors. F5 BIG-IP What is F5 BIG-IP? A platform used to control traffic that passes through an enterprise network, developed by US company F5. 4 May 2022 F5 publicly disclosed a vulnerability in BIG-IP network devices that allowed malicious actors to execute arbitrary commands, create or delete files, or disable services. F5 encouraged users running at-risk versions to upgrade as soon as possible.   6 May 2022 ACSC performed CHIPs scanning to determine how many Australian devices were vulnerable, and notified government operators.   6-7 May 2022 Just days after the vulnerability was disclosed, researchers published exploits, with malicious actors soon using them in attacks across the internet.   9 May 2022 The ACSC published an Advisory addressing multiple vulnerabilities in the F5 BIG-IP Product Range. Exploits which required just 2 commands and some headers became publicly known. The vulnerability was so easy to exploit that some security researchers speculated that it did not end up in the products by accident.   10 May 2022 Security researchers tweeted that real world devices are being erased. The ACSC received its first reported Australian incidents relating to exploitation of F5. Key takeaway In an environment where multiple vulnerabilities are disclosed, rapid patching is not enough. Organisations must also monitor for indicators of compromise. The scalability and low cost of automated cyber exploitation techniques mean the driver for this type of compromise is likely to be the existence of vulnerabilities in victim organisations, rather than an adversarys interest in a particular network. This ability of a wide array of cyber threat actors to compromise multiple networks, and then assess the value of those accesses, will make it more difficult to attribute a specific motive for targeting an individual Australian network. Log4j The most prevalent critical vulnerability in the 202122 financial year was Log4j. Log4j is a popular software building block found in a wide variety of Java applications. It provides logging functionality, recording the activity of the software in order to diagnose problems. Over 100,000 products may contain Log4jas Log4j is open source software, there is no definitive list. The series of Log4j vulnerabilities made public in December 2021 were trivial to exploit. The vulnerability could be used to execute code on the servers of the Minecraft video game by pasting messages into a chat box, for example. In response to the Log4j vulnerabilities, the ACSC raised awareness, provided timely advice, and worked closely with government, industry partners and impacted organisations to protect against exploitation of this vulnerability. Over December 2021  January 2022, the ACSC provided technical support to impacted organisations, released 2 critical Alerts and 2 Advisories that were regularly updated, hosted 7 information sharing events through the ACSC Partnership Program, and amplified advice on social media which had a potential reach of over one million people. The ACSC is aware of malicious actors, including sophisticated cyber threat actors, conducting a large number of reconnaissance scans for Log4j vulnerabilities. Some Australian networks were compromised through Log4j, and the ACSC responded to over 50 cyber security incidents. The ACSC has identified Log4j exploits being used months after the initial disclosure. Malicious actors also routinely scan for vulnerabilities years after they are initially disclosed, targeting networks which are running legacy software or have failed to patch. For instance, a 28 April 2022 Joint Five-Eyes Advisory observed that 6 of the top 15 Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities in 2021 were first disclosed in 2020 or earlier. Log4j is likely to be a means of access for malicious actors for years to come. Log4j Timeline 24 November 2021 The cloud security team of Chinese company Alibaba privately reported the Log4j vulnerability to the software developer.   10 December 2021 The vulnerability was publicly disclosed by cyber security researchers. The ACSC issued a public Alert the same day and commenced a comprehensive suite of awareness and response initiatives to prevent potential compromises.   13 December 2021 The ACSC commenced technical incident response assistance to impacted organisations, and commenced briefings of the National Cyber Security Committee, Australian Government Chief Information Officers and industry partners.   14 December 2021 The ACSC published an updated Alert advising the ACSC had observed active exploitation of this vulnerability within Australia.   15 December 2021 The ACSC published a public technical Advisory.   16-22 December 2021 The ACSC published additional Alerts and Advisories, and public webinars.   23 December 2021 The ACSC published an additional Alert, highlighting malicious actors using Log4j for ransomware activities. What should you do Patching and uplifting networks In the face of increasingly rapid critical vulnerabilities, applying patches to applications and operating systems has become even more essential. Once a security vulnerability in an internet-facing service is made public, it can be expected that malicious code will be developed by adversaries within 48 hours. There are cases in which adversaries have developed malicious code within hours of newly discovered security vulnerabilities. The ACSC therefore recommends patching internet-facing services within 48 hours if an exploit exists. More detailed advice is available in the ACSC publication Assessing Security Vulnerabilities and Applying Patches. Some sectors of the Australian economy have lagged in their patching rates. A limited analysis of patching rates following the 2021 Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities, for instance, indicated that the Professional, Scientific and Technical Services sector had the highest number of unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers overall, with a rate of unpatched servers significantly higher than its share of the economy by number of businesses. This sector includes industries such as legal and accounting services, which hold significant volumes of personal information on clients. In addition to rapid patching, organisations need to monitor for Indicators of Compromise, as compromise may have already occurred before the release or application of patches. This is especially so for zero-day exploitsvulnerabilities which have been exploited before becoming publicly known. For instance, Log4j was first exploited at least 10 days before being publicly disclosed. It is vital that patching is comprehensive, and legacy assets are accounted for. Many organisations struggle to maintain an accurate inventory of their ICT assets, and malicious actors know that the easiest path to a target network is often through unknown or abandoned ICT assets. The ACSC recognises that some sectors have unique requirements, such as legacy operational technology, and offers tailored uplift advice for such sectors. Cyber defence and resilience Malicious actors are exploiting Australians desire for interconnected digital services. Organisations can improve their cyber posture through implementing the Essential Eight. Individuals should employ automatic updates and replace obsolete software and hardware. Interconnectivity brings risks and opportunities The virtualisation of Australian life that accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic has become entrenched. Remote working arrangements have given way to a hybrid working model, further increasing cyber security risks as employees switch regularly between personal and corporate devices. For example, small office/home office (SOHO) modems, routers and network-attached storage are usually insecurely designed with minimal security maintenance. SOHO routers are notorious for having insecure firmware, hardcoded backdoors, and inconsistent patching. Even if secure patches are available, individual users are highly unlikely to install them. And most SOHO routers manufactured before 2017 have no ability to automatically update firmware. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things is growing by billions of devices each year and will introduce new types of vulnerabilitiesfor instance, in April 2022, researchers released a proof of concept for compromising smart speakers by having the device issue voice commands to itself. The blurring of work and home lives has made the information held by individuals more valuable to malicious actors. Email accounts listed in PII holdings will almost certainly be under increased threat of spear phishing activity. The theft of PII creates a risk that ordinary Australians will be victimised and need substantial support. In some cases, a victim will be impacted for the rest of their life as exposure of their personal information, once leaked or sold, cannot necessarily be remediated. As interconnectivity grows, malicious actors are increasingly looking to compromise multiple victims across a range of sectors via a single entry point. The ACSC expects this trend to continue. For example, MSPs were targeted over 202122 as they are used by government, commercial and not-for-profit businesses of all sizes, making them an attractive target for malicious actors. Malicious actors increasingly view the supply chain as a priority target and a vector for compromise. Case Study: Kaseya supply chain ransomware attack In July 2021, US ICT management provider Kaseya became the victim of a sophisticated ransomware cyberattack, which exploited a vulnerability in remote management software. This allowed the ransomware affiliate to carry out a supply chain compromise of Kaseyas customers. The cybercriminal group responsible demanded USD 70 million in Bitcoin for a universal decryption key that would unlock customer data. Kaseya responded by advising on-premises customers to shut down affected servers, and subsequently released a compromise detection tool and software patches to customers. The company also warned of spammers exploiting the incident by sending phishing emails that had fake notifications with malicious links. Due to Kaseyas swift response, the attack was contained to fewer than 60 MSPs of its more than 37,000 customers worldwide, and between 800 and 1500 downstream customers, including 3 affected MSPs in Australia. From 4 to 5 July 2021, the ACSC responded to a small number of cyber security incidents involving Australian entities affected by the Kaseya software compromise, including businesses in the Education, Health, and Professional, Scientific and Technical Services sectors. The ACSC also published an Advisory on the Kaseya ransomware attack. On 22 July 2021, Kaseya obtained a universal decryption key to unlock its files and those of its customers, which allowed Kaseya to restore functionality to all of its clients. Kaseya has stated publicly that it did not pay a ransom to the cybercrime affiliate responsible for the attack. While interconnectivity introduces new risks, it also presents opportunities. Workplaces have become more resilient through remote working arrangements and greater use of cloud services, reducing the risk of single points of failure within in-house networks. Improved interconnectivity between government and industry is allowing real-time sharing of threat intelligence, enabling organisations such as financial institutions to better protect PII. What is the ACSC doing? The ACSC is delivering a range of initiatives that streamlineand where possible, automateactive cyber defence and intelligence sharing. REDSPICE will further strengthen Australias cyber defences. ACSC initiative: CTIS The CTIS service enables the sharing of cyber threat intelligence at machine speed. Through the use of automation, participating entities receive cyber threat intelligence in a structured and timely manner. The CTIS Data Model enables partners to share cyber threat intelligence through a common language and outlines standards to share data in alignment to the 5 Cs: Content, Context, Clarity, Communication and Confidence. On 1 November 2021, the bi-directional CTIS platform went live. On 19 November 2021, the ACSC facilitated the first successful bi-directional share between a commercial entity (National Australia Bank - NAB) and a government department. Cyber Threat Intelligence shared by members via CTIS is made available to other members in order to support the identification of malicious cyber activity in their environments. In one instance, intelligence shared by NAB provided the means to identify suspicious cyber activity in an environment that ACSC previously had no visibility of. 25,341 indicators have been provided by the ACSC, including from victims who are not ACSC Partners. 741 have been provided by CTIS analysts working for ACSC's delivery partner, Deloitte. 2,261 have been shared with CTIS by ACSC Partners. Following an early release to a sample-set of partners, CTIS was released broadly to ACSC network partners in June 2022. ACSC initiative: Australian Protective Domain Name System The Australian Protective Domain Name System (AUPDNS) is dedicated to protecting government networks. The system uses verified threat intelligence to build a block list of known malicious web domains. Providing protection against malware, spyware phishing attacks, viruses, and malicious sites, AUPDNS monitors connections between an organisations network and the internet. AUPDNS also stops malware already on devices from calling home, mitigating the damage from an attack. The information captured within AUPDNS also helps build the ACSCs cyber threat picture. In the 202122 financial year, AUPDNS processed more than 36 billion queries, and blocked over 24 million domain requests. AUPDNS onboarded 171 organisations, including a number of state and local government agencies. ACSC initiative: Domain Takedown Service n response to the increasing threat posed by domains hosting malicious software, the ACSC launched the Domain Takedown Service pilot in 2021. Upon detecting suspected malicious software, the service verifies maliciousness before issuing a takedown notification request to the relevant Domain Host. The service also operates 10 honeypot servers on Australian IP ranges, giving the ACSC the ability to directly report malicious domains for manual verification and takedown. The service only targets those attack types which fall under ASDs cyber security function as per the Intelligence Services Act 2001. In 202122, the service focused on 4 lines of effort: Line of effort Number of notifications issues Number of takedowns Targeting success rate Government (Australian, state & territory, local) 1,352 1,333 99% Australian vaccine rollout 16,291 15,932 98% Flubot text message malware 19,117 19,117 100% Brute force attacks against Australian servers 29,446 29,278 99% Uplifting an interconnected Australian economy Australias best defence in a rapidly evolving cyber threat environment is to build resilience across businesses and organisations, and among individuals. As vulnerabilities and interdependencies increase, preventative cyber security measures are not sufficient; organisations should also develop and test incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Commercial incident response providers have a particularly important role to play; they offer services to organisations which may have limited in-house capabilities, as well as reduce demand on the ACSCs finite incident response capabilities. The ACSC is conducting a suite of incident response transformation activities to increase information sharing and reporting, while growing the scale and maturity of commercial providers and the cyber security sector as a whole. The consequences for organisations which fail to manage cyber security incidents are clear. In May 2022, the Federal Court of Australia found that financial planning firm RI Advice had breached its financial services license obligations by having inadequate cybersecurity risk management systems. While the judgement does not set a legal standard for Australian Financial Services Licencees or other organisations, it is a strong reminder that company boards should consider cyber resilience as part of their statutory responsibilities. The ACSC publishes tailored advice for company boards, such as the January 2022 publication Log4j: What Boards and Directors Need to Know. The ACSC also directly engages senior executives through the Joint Cyber Security Centres. Case Study: Qantas Qantas and the ACSC have been sharing knowledge for over 12 years. In 2015, Qantas was part of the Prime Ministers Incident Response Taskforce and has participated in multiple other exercises. The ACSC and Qantas now have information exchange agreements and dedicated liaison personnel. Qantas regularly checks with the ACSC to verify intelligence gathered from other sources, seeks advice on new and unusual cyber security challenges, and seeks feedback on its incident response processes. The ACSC also learns from Qantas. Qantas shares insights with ACSC analysts on how threat information and leads are gathered and managed in the private sector. The ACSC, Qantas and other aviation sector partners are also members of the Australian Aviation Cyber Council. During 202122, the benefits of the partnership were demonstrated during Qantas's involvement in the Australian Governments distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. It was in the national interest to ensure that the vaccine distribution process was not interrupted by a cyberattack, and Qantas and the ACSC worked closely to make sure Qantass cyber protections were fit for the task. Qantas Group Chief Information Security Officer Jeffrey Choi stated, My team continues to benefit from sharing knowledge and expertise with the ACSC, as well as through forums with industry peers. ACSCs Advisories and threat intelligence have given the Qantas Group greater visibility of the threat landscape in which we operate. What can my organisation do? Essential Eight The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has developed prioritised mitigation strategiesin the form of the Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidentsto help organisations protect themselves against various cyber threats. The Essential Eight Maturity Model, first published in June 2017 and updated regularly, supports the implementation of the Essential Eight. It is based on the ACSCs experience in producing cyber threat intelligence, responding to cyber security incidents, conducting penetration testing and assisting organisations to implement the Essential Eight. The Essential Eight remains highly relevant, with a major update released in July 2021. In recognition of the degrading cyber threat environment, in March 2022 the Attorney-Generals Department mandated the Essential Eight for all non-corporate Commonwealth entities through amendments to the Protective Security Policy Framework. Become an ACSC Partner The ACSC Partnership Program facilitates ACSC engagement with Australian organisations and individuals to lift cyber resilience across the Australian economy. The ACSC Partnership Program comprises 3 tiers to reach the entire Australian economy: Network Partners  for organisations with responsibility for their own ICT environments, experts in cyber security such as academics, and not-for-profit institutions. The community of ACSC Network Partners includes cyber security professionals across government, industry, and academia. Bringing together the situational awareness, technical expertise and experience of this community allows the collective public and private sectors to support and learn from each other. ACSC Network Partners are provided access to threat intelligence, news and advice to enhance situational awareness; collaboration opportunities with fellow cyber security professionals; and resilience-building activities (such as exercises, discussions, workshops). Business Partners  for businesses that would like to be kept up to date with relevant cyber security information for their businesses, including those not eligible for the Network Partner tier. This tier of partnership provides organisations with a better understanding of the cyber security landscape and outlines the steps required to protect themselves from cyber security threats. They receive a subscription to the ACSC Alert Service and a monthly newsletter containing news, publications and Advisories produced by the ACSC. Home Partners  for individuals and families that would like to be kept up to date with relevant information. ACSC Home Partners receive a subscription to the ACSC Alert Service, providing them with a better understanding of the cyber security environment. Joint Cyber Security Centres The JCSCs support the Network Partner tier of the ACSC Partnership Program to bring together businesses and the research community, along with Australian, state and territory government agencies, in an open and cooperative environment. JCSCs in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Hobart, along with a virtual JCSC in Darwin, provide opportunities for the Australian cyber security community to come together in a trusted, neutral environment to drive collaboration and information-sharing. Over the 202122 financial year, ACSC Network Partner membership has increased by 34 per cent, now comprising over 2,300 partners. Business Partners increased by 65 per cent to over 3,400 and Home Partners by 8 per cent to over 82,000. What can individuals do?

Overall, the report found that Commonwealth entities continued to improve their cyber security in 2020. Ongoing effort is required to maintain the currency and effectiveness of cyber security measures. Executive Summary The Commonwealth Cyber Security Posture in 2020 (the Report) informs the Parliament of the status of the Commonwealths cyber security posture. Overall, the Report finds that Commonwealth entities continued to improve their cyber security in 2020. Commonwealth entities have responded efficiently to cyber security advice and assistance and have increased their cyber security posture through improved alignment with the Essential Eight Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, basic cyber hygiene and business practices, and responses to cyber security incidents. The cyber threat environment has deteriorated in 2020. The Australian Signals Directorates (ASDs) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has noted an increase in the number of cybercrime reports and cyber security incidents. In addition, the ACSC has noted an increase in frequency and sophistication of operations by a range of state-based actors and cybercriminal syndicates. The ACSC has also noted an increase in the speed in which malicious actors have researched and then pivoted to exploit publicly-released vulnerabilities. Levels of cyber security maturity continue to vary across the Australian government and sustained effort is required for Commonwealth entities to meet the challenges of the evolving cyber threat environment. Results from the ACSC Cyber Security Survey showed improvement in Commonwealth entity implementation of the Essential Eight strategies relating to user application hardening, application control, restricting administrative privileges and adopting daily backups. However, the baseline adoption of the Essential Eight across the Australian government still requires further improvement to meet the rapidly evolving cyber threat environment. Australias Cyber Security Strategy 2020 positions the Australian government to better meet these evolving cyber threats, investing $1.67 billion over ten years to strengthen Australias cyber security, including $1.35 billion for the Cyber Enhanced Situational Awareness and Response (CESAR) package. The CESAR package will maintain and enhance the cyber security capabilities of the ACSC and the assistance provided to Australians over the next decade. The CESAR package will enable the ACSC to identify more cyber threats, disrupt more foreign cybercriminals, build new partnerships with industry and government, and protect more Australians. The ACSCs enhanced capability and situational awareness will assist Commonwealth entities to improve and maintain their cyber security posture and resilience. The Australian government continues to grow capability, delivering positive cyber security outcomes for Commonwealth entities. In particular during 2020: the Cyber Hygiene Improvement Programs increased coverage of active Commonwealth government domains by about 320% over 150,000 threat events were prevented through a pilot Protective Domain Name System (PDNS) program the pool of independent assessors under the Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) grew by approximately 9%. The Australian government will also continue to strengthen its cyber security capabilities through the Harden Government IT Initiative, established as part of Australias Cyber Security Strategy 2020. Centralising the management and operations of information and communications technology (ICT) systems run by Commonwealth entities will help strengthen the governments cyber security posture and improve cyber resilience across those entities. The next report will be delivered in November 2022. The change in timing is to align with financial years, enabling clearer reporting, particularly in relation to significant Commonwealth funding commitments. Instead of crossing two financial years, each new report, from 2023 onwards, will focus on the cyber security posture for a single financial year. The report delivered in November 2022 will be a hybrid report, covering 1 January 2021 to 30 June 2022.Report a cyber security incident for critical infrastructure Get alerts on new threats Alert Service Become an ACSC Partner Report a cybercrime or cyber security incidentAcknowledgement of Country We acknowledge the Traditional Owners and Custodians of Country throughout Australia and their continuing connections to land, sea and communities.

The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) published a record number of cyber alerts in 2020, and late last year identified a sustained campaign by sophisticated cybercrime actors impacting the Australian health sector.1 So there is no time for complacency.Australias resilience to the pandemic provides an opportunity to strengthen our cyber defences. As this pandemic has demonstrated, taking a proactive approach to foreseeable problems is by far the most effective strategy in the long run.The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) warns that various forms of cyber attacks, including ransomware, are rising in volume and sophistication. The healthcare sector is particularly likely to be targeted for multiple reasons, such as the inherent value of healthcare data in general (and vaccine-related intellectual property in particular), as well as potential vulnerabilities arising from rapidly implemented pandemic response related workflows and workarounds.Fortunately, implementing a few simple countermeasures will greatly reduce your risk of cyber attack, and may also improve the resilience and functionality of your information systems.Software updates and patches routinely include security updates that address vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Cyber criminals can be surprisingly agile in exploiting vulnerabilities, so it is important to have a responsive process in place to receive patch notifications when they become available, and ensure they are assessed, tested, and deployed in a timely manner.The ACSC reported in March 2021 that malicious actors are exploiting Microsoft Exchange servers2, and strongly recommends applying the latest updates immediately to address this vulnerability. Detailed technical advice is also available for those who need it.3There is a growing understanding that the creation of safe environments requires a certain amount of shared vigilance. Weve all learned how to mitigate the pandemic through social distancing and other measures. A very similar security awareness needs to be developed to manage cyber security risks. Its not just a job for experts, its something that we all need to maintain awareness of as we go about our daily lives.4The Agencys Digital Health Security Awareness course is a free online training program that focuses on cultivating cyber security awareness across the health sector. With regular reinforcement, this new level of awareness can become an embedded part your organisations culture, to the benefit of yourself, your colleagues, and the people you serve.Scammers may try to obtain your personal information by claiming it is required for you to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Dont give personal information to anyone who calls you about the vaccine. Vaccine offers that ask for personal or financial information are scams. If you receive unexpected emails or text messages about the vaccine, dont click on any links. They may contain malware and give your personal information to a scammer.5To learn more and to keep up to date regarding evolving security threats, subscribe to the following free security alert and news services:1 Australian Cyber Security Centre (October 2020) Sustained targeting of the health sector 2 Australian Cyber Security Centre (March 2021) Exchange server critical vulnerabilities 3 Australian Cyber Security Centre (March 2021) Advisory 2021-002: Active exploitation of vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers 4 Australian Digital Health Agency (March 2019) Security Behaviours: Encouraging everyone to be aware of information security 5 Scamwatch COVID-19 vaccination scams"

Planes that dont crash, cars that dont collide, and networks that work flawlessly are usually not that newsworthy. And you may have noticed that cyber security has been in the news quite a bit lately, especially after the recent series of high profile cyber-attacks in Australia and overseas.Cyber security hasnt always been front page news, so what has changed? And what can we do about it?One might wonder if these events are part of the post-pandemic new normal, and it is certainly true that the surge in remote and home-based working has created tempting openings for malicious actors. However, the deeper and more fundamental truth is that the cyber security landscape continually evolves as circumstances change, new attack methods are developed, and new threat actors emerge. The upshot of all this is that cyber security advice and defence will also evolve over time.The dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and cyber safety have a great deal in common and we can improve our understanding with some useful analogies.Very much as in healthcare, the inconvenience and disruption associated with removing and repairing a malware infection is vastly greater than any inconvenience imposed by prevention strategies.Your IT provider routinely prevents attempted cyber-attacks from reaching your systems through network monitoring, firewalls, and other techniques. Nonetheless, some malicious content will occasionally breach these defences, so general security awareness by everyone is an important protective factor.To lift security awareness across the health sector, we have developed a free Digital Health Security Awareness eLearning course, specifically designed to meet the needs of Australian healthcare providers.Cyber-attacks are likewise evolving as malicious actors seek new ways to evade existing defences. As a result, cyber safety advice will continue to evolve over time.Cyber hygiene is fundamental to ensuring cyber safety, i.e. minimising unnecessary connections, isolating suspected cases of infection, and endeavouring to reduce the risk of exposure to contagion.Interpol have developed a striking security awareness campaign based on this theme.According to Microsoft, implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) across your organisation can block over 99.9% of attacks on your user accounts.1 This robust security solution is increasingly being offered to help individual and organisations protect their valuable information.MFA requires the user to supply a different form of authentication in addition to a password in order to access your network. MFA is a powerful defence against most forms of password attack (e.g. brute force, password spraying, or credential dumping) because the password by itself is no longer sufficient to enable access.Implementing MFA can take some time to get used to, but its a sound investment in your online security and peace of mind.1.

Software vendors with clinical software products will be supported to implement changes to their products in a phased approach, to balance the need to strengthen security for all systems connected to My Health Record with the capability of software vendors to make necessary adjustments in a timely manner. The profile was co-developed with stakeholders including regulators, software vendors and security experts.The profile contains an evidence-based suite of security requirements that harden clinical information systems from cyber security attacks, uplift information security and provide better protection for consumer information. Each vendor with software products connected to My Health Record will be required to submit extensive evidence to demonstrate conformance to each requirement, as well as participate in an observation session conducted by an Agency specialist team.Australian Digital Health Agency Acting Chief Digital Officer, Dr. Holger Kaufmann said, Protecting sensitive information is essential in the provision of healthcare services and is a fundamental capability that is required to enable connected healthcare systems and safe, seamless, secure, and confidential information sharing across all healthcare providers.The Agency has and will continue to work with clinical information system vendors to provide support and guidance to further secure and protect their software for the benefit of patient privacy, national infrastructure, and their own businesses he said.The new requirements align to the best-practice standards recommended by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC),  detailed in the ACSCs Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents, known as the Essential Eight, that help protect systems against a range of online and cyber security threats.Media contact Mobile: 0428 772 421 Email: media@digitalhealth.gov.au  About the Australian Digital Health Agency When it comes to improving the health of all Australians, the role of digital innovation and connection is a vital part of a modern, accessible healthcare system.
